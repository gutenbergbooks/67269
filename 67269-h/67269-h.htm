<h3>
CHAPTER 1
</h3>

<p>
The old-fashioned Deming mansion, for the hundredth
time in its sedate existence, was filled with
a gayety which offset even the menacing weather.
</p>

<p>
Although noon was close at hand, the morning was deeply
gloomy and ominous.  Thunder clouds of late summer
brooded over the Ohio, and rain, already sweeping across
the wide crescent-bend of the river, was threatening to
burst upon Evansville.  Yet it was not because of these
clouds that the old house was ablaze with light from cellar
to attic.
</p>

<p>
From the twelve-foot ceilings of the huge rooms hung
electric clusters, whose glare was softened yet quickened by
tinkling prisms and pendants of crystal.  Along the walls
twinkled sconces and candelabra; this richer glow brought
out the scarlet coats of tapestried huntsmen, pursuing stags
through indefinite forests of Gobelin weave.  Everywhere
was light and sound and laughter.
</p>

<p>
A babel of tongues filled the rooms&mdash;crisply concise
northern speech, mingled with the softer slur of southern
accents.  A listener might gather that this house was
symbolic of Evansville itself, bordering both north and south,
drinking of its best from either section; an Indiana city,
yet of infinite variety, proudly exclusive, living more in
past than present, yet cordial and open-hearthed.
</p>

<p>
At noon, in this house, Dorothy Deming was to be married
to Reese Armstrong.  The wedding was yet some little
distance away.  Macgowan, who had been dressing for his
part of best man and who was a house guest, crossed the
upstairs hall toward the stairway, just as Dorothy herself
appeared from a room which was aflutter with excited feminine
voices.  With the license of his age and position, he
led her to the window-nook and began to speak of
Armstrong.  Dorothy, oblivious of the confusion around,
yielded to the detention and listened eagerly.
</p>

<p>
Why not?  When Lawrence Macgowan spoke, few men
but would have listened; not to mention a bride who was
chatting with the groom's most intimate and trusted friend,
and hearing wondrous things about the man whom she was
soon to call her husband.
</p>

<p>
Macgowan was impressive.  More impressive than
J. Fortescue Deming, in whose features the Deming Food
Products Company had seared deep lines; more impressive
than Deming's business directors and social friends here
gathered; more impressive by far than young Armstrong,
whose financial genius was making its mark so rapidly.
</p>

<p>
Despite the gray at his temples, Lawrence Macgowan
possessed a charm of personality, a steely keenness of
intellect, a direct force of character, which dominated all who
came in contact with him.  Being quite used to making
this impression, he made it the more readily.  Men said of
Macgowan that he disdained politics, had refused a
supreme court appointment, and preferred corporation law
to marriage as a means of advancement.  True,&mdash;perhaps.
Among the doctors of the law, among those upright ones
who lived rigorously by legal ethics and by ethical illegality,
Macgowan moved as a very Gamaliel, honored in the
Sanhedrim and respected by all those whose fortunes his brain
had made.
</p>

<p>
Men said, too, that some day he would set that brain to
making his own fortune.
</p>

<p>
"Then," Dorothy was inquiring, "you and Reese are
looking this very minute for some new business to take
hold of?  And you haven't found one?"
</p>

<p>
Macgowan evaded, smilingly.  His whole person seemed
to radiate that smile as some rich crystal radiates and
warms the sunlight, and when he thus smiled all the
strong lines of his face were softened; his level gaze lost
its almost harsh intensity and became winning, genial,
intimate.
</p>

<p>
"We're not looking, exactly," he said.  "You see, we're
more sought after than seeking&mdash;though I should not
include myself.  Reese is the whole thing.  It's his genius
that is the very breath of life in Consolidated.  Do you
know that he's put nearly sixteen thousand investors on our
books by his sheer selling ability?  He has actually sold
himself to them.  All small ones, people who can invest
only a few hundred dollars each year.  That is more than
an accomplishment; it is a triumph!"
</p>

<p>
The girl's cheeks were flushed, her blue eyes shone like
stars.
</p>

<p>
"But it's your help, your faith and backing, which made
such big things possible for him.  To think that he's been
in New York only a year or two!  To think where he will
be after ten years&mdash;"  Dorothy broke off, caught her
breath sharply, and laughed at her own enthusiasm.  "Oh,
I'm intoxicated with the very thought of what he's
accomplished and what he will accomplish!  Now tell me
about the companies you-all handle.  Do you buy them and
then sell them later for more money?"
</p>

<p>
Macgowan shook his head.  "No.  A manufacturing
concern, let us say, is poorly managed yet essentially
sound.  We buy it.  We reorganize it.  Consolidated
Securities owns it and continues to own it.  A minority of
the stock is sold to our investors, to the people who own
Consolidated stock.  It is their privilege to buy stock in
this subsidiary company&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"The preferred stock?" cut in Dorothy.  Macgowan
chuckled at her sapient air.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Two shares and no more to each investor, but
with these two shares goes one share of common at a
nominal valuation.  Suppose we start or reorganize two or
three such companies in the course of a year&mdash;and we hope
to do better than that&mdash;the chances are very good for our
investors.  Consolidated sells the stock, owns the subsidiary
company, runs it!  Thus, Consolidated must make sure
that the company will not fail but succeed.  The investor
shares the profit with Consolidated; also, he shares
Consolidated's profit from the whole group of companies.  You
see the idea?"
</p>

<p>
Dorothy nodded quickly, then was checked by Macgowan's
air.
</p>

<p>
"There's just one thing."  His tone was hesitant,
embarrassed.  Her eyes leaped to his face; his voice seemed to
bring a swift apprehension into her mind.
</p>

<p>
"Yes?" she urged him with an eager word.
</p>

<p>
"There is one thing&mdash;"  Macgowan was unaccountably
at a loss for speech; to any who knew him well, an
astounding thing.  "You understand, the success of Reese
Armstrong means everything to me; I may call myself his
closest friend, at least in New York.  And I know, my
dear, that with you at his elbow, with your faith and help
behind him, he is invincible."
</p>

<p>
Suspense flashed into the girl's eyes.  This prelude, this
slightly frowning air of embarrassment, hinted at some
portentous secret.
</p>

<p>
"Yes?" she prompted again.
</p>

<p>
The lawyer regarded her a long moment, his eyes gravely
steady.
</p>

<p>
"Well, there is one thing I want to say to you; that's
why I dragged you away for a few moments.  Yet I don't
want to offend you, my dear."
</p>

<p>
"You won't&mdash;it's a promise!  What is it?"
</p>

<p>
"One thing, for his happiness and yours.  He is a
wizard at finance; success has not flung him off balance, for
his one thought has ever been of work.  Now, my dear
Dorothy, don't let him drink too deeply of this wine of
wizardry!  No man can serve two masters.  Business takes
its toll of souls, I can assure you; it hardens the spirit,
until nothing is left sacred before its spell.  A man will rob
his best friend in the name of business.  He will take what
he can grasp, and call it finance.  You must see to it that
Reese is not too entirely absorbed in his work&mdash;that he is
not dominated by the nimble dollar."
</p>

<p>
For a moment the girl met Macgowan's steady gaze,
probing for the meaning underneath his words.  In her eyes
rose a question, a quick protest, an argument.
</p>

<p>
Then, before she could respond, came a breathless outcry,
a swish of skirts, and two bridesmaids seized upon her.
</p>

<p>
"Dorothy, you shameless thing!  These brides&mdash;they
all need a guardian!  You've driven us perfectly <i>wild</i>!
Don't you know that we've been looking everywhere for
you?  It's time you were dressed&mdash;your mother's waiting&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Dorothy was hustled away in peremptory fashion.
</p>

<p>
Macgowan, smiling a little to himself, sauntered away
and downstairs.  As he entered the great drawing-room
he was instantly seized upon.  New guests were each
moment arriving and Macgowan, who was to be best man,
was the lion of the hour.  Armstrong had not yet
summoned him for moral support, and he was momentarily
free.
</p>

<p>
This home wedding in its very informality held a formal
dignity which was novel to the New Yorker, and which he
found delightful.  Many of those present were out-of-town
house guests, and all were old friends of the bride;
Armstrong had invited only his best man.  Thus the affair had
a strong sense of family intimacy.
</p>

<p>
Macgowan was quick to feel any psychic and underlying
influence.  Behind all this glitter he perceived a curious
restraint, a pride, a singular cool dignity.  Through the
babel of voices, underneath the laughing faces, he was
vaguely aware of this thing.  It was as though many of
these people, guests in this house, shared some secret
which they were trying to banish from memory or thought.
</p>

<p>
Lawrence Macgowan knew exactly what this hidden thing
was.
</p>

<p>
He was no untutored denizen of the metropolis who
viewed the country at large only through the uncertain
eyes of the press.  He even had direct connections with
Evansville; across the room he saw his cousin, Ried
Williams, a director and treasurer of the Deming company.
The relationship was not, however, known to many; even
Armstrong was unaware of it.  Macgowan made his way
to the side of Williams and clapped him on the shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Ried?  How are you?"
</p>

<p>
"Hello, Lawrence!"  The thin, sallow features of Williams
suddenly radiated delight.  "Here, I want you to
meet Pete Slosson, our assistant general manager.  Pete,
this is Lawrence Macgowan; a man to whom the law is a
servitor and shield, the Constitution an act of providence,
and state legislatures mere soda-water bubbles&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Laughing, Macgowan shook hands with Pete Slosson.  A
young man, this, of singularly clear-cut and intelligent
features; yet the eyes were a bit sullen, the lips a trifle full.
The entire face displayed a nervous energy not wholly
natural.  The man drank.
</p>

<p>
"Everything Lawrence touches," continued Williams
warmly, "and every one in touch with him, succeeds!  He
simply never makes a failure of anything."
</p>

<p>
"Then I'll make a touch," Slosson grinned, "because
I'm going to be broke one of these days."
</p>

<p>
Macgowan chuckled.  "Any time you like," he returned.
"But remember that the golden touch of Midas went
against him at the last!"
</p>

<p>
One watching these three men closely might have fancied
that beneath their light words lay some deeper significance.
</p>

<p>
At this moment the negro butler approached.  He deftly
bore a huge tray, upon which crowded tall silver cups,
crowned with the rich green of new mint and steaming
frostily from their iced contents.
</p>

<p>
"Compliments of the bride, gentlemen!" he addressed
them.  "If you-all is prohibition, dishyer in de centuh is
gwineteed not to obstruct yo' feelin's or beliefs&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Not for us, Uncle Neb!" Slosson laughed loudly, as
he extended one of the juleps to Macgowan.  "Here's a
treat for you, effete easterner!  Uncle Neb's cocktails are
famous from here to Nashville, but his juleps are symphonic
memories of the good old days.  Take a long whiff of the
mint first, mind; there's only one way to drink a julep.
That right, Uncle Neb?"
</p>

<p>
"Dat sho' is de truth, Mistah Slosson!"  The old negro
was beaming.  "Yas, suh.  Folks sho' do prove dey quality
on de julep.  Ain't dat de truth, Mistah Slosson?  M-mm!
And Mistah Deming he done growed dat mint his own self,
too&mdash;ain't nobody knows mint like he do!"
</p>

<p>
Macgowan sniffed deeply of the raw fragrance, and raised
his goblet.
</p>

<p>
"Gentlemen, I give you the health of the bride!"
</p>

<p>
At these words, an almost imperceptible contraction
occurred in the features of Slosson.  Faint as was this
movement of the facial muscles, instantly as it vanished,
Macgowan observed it.
</p>

<p>
After this, he took a deep and lively interest in Pete
Slosson; and Slosson, flattered, talked freely enough.  Any
man would have been flattered to hold the absorbed
attention of Macgowan.
</p>

<p>
"You're wasting your talents here, Slosson," said
Macgowan at last.  His tone was abrupt and incisive, and
confidential in the extreme.  "You ought to have a year or
two in Chicago or Indianapolis, handling bigger things,
then come on to New York.  There's no advancement for
a man like you in this town."
</p>

<p>
Slosson listened with sulky eyes.
</p>

<p>
"All very well," he returned.  "But I'm a director,
and assistant general manager of Food Products&mdash;which
is a big thing here.  If I went to Indianapolis, where'd I
be?  I've no pull up there."
</p>

<p>
Macgowan's thin lips curved slightly at this.
</p>

<p>
"Then you don't care to handle bigger things?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course I do!" snapped Slosson.  "Will you give me
a chance at 'em?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Macgowan coolly.  "Yes.  Not now, though.
Later on&mdash;when some things that are in the air have worked
around right."
</p>

<p>
"Good!  Then count on me.  Between the two of us,
Food Products is going to pieces soon."
</p>

<p>
Macgowan merely nodded indifferently.  "Why?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
Slosson shrugged.
</p>

<p>
"How the devil should I know?  Business depression,
of course.  We have a good line and it sells, but luck's
against us.  There's Deming now.  Good lord!  Look at
his face!"
</p>

<p>
The two men turned.  Their host had halted in the
doorway and was signing the book of a messenger.  A telegram
was in his hand.
</p>

<p>
Macgowan, not at all astonished by the information just
confided to him, searched the face of Deming.  He read
there confirmation of Slosson's words.  Indubitably, the
man was keenly worried.  That elderly, handsome face
was deeply lined with care; a far and deep-hidden weakness,
a frightened panic, was about the eyes.  As he stood
there in the doorway, Deming tore open the envelope and
glanced at the telegram which unfolded in his hand.
</p>

<p>
Even by the artificial light, Macgowan saw the deathly
pallor that leaped into the man's face; he saw the fingers
tremble, saw the frightful despair that sprang to the eyes.
For one instant Deming lifted his head, stared blankly
around, then turned and was gone.  After him hurried
Slosson, concerned and anxious.
</p>

<p>
Macgowan felt a touch at his elbow.  He turned to find
Ried Williams, who had perceived nothing of this happening
in the doorway.  His rather crafty eyes met the glance
of Macgowan with a saturnine air.
</p>

<p>
"What d'you think of Slosson, Lawrence?"
</p>

<p>
"Good man."  Macgowan glanced at his watch.  "Well,
I must be off to find Armstrong&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You don't know about Slosson, then?"
</p>

<p>
Macgowan regarded his cousin steadily.
</p>

<p>
"Disappointed rival; he'd always counted on marrying
Dorothy.  I've been afraid he'd take a drop too much and
make a scene, but he has a good head.  And see here,
Lawrence!  How long have I known you?"
</p>

<p>
"Longer than I like to think about," and Macgowan
chuckled in his hearty manner.
</p>

<p>
"Yes."  Williams looked at him appraisingly, keenly.
"Don't wriggle with me, Lawrence.  You have devilish
deep meanings to some things you say.  When you said
Slosson was a good man, you meant something.  What's
in the air?"
</p>

<p>
Macgowan frowned slightly.  "Nothing, except wedding
bells."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!"  An ironic smile lighted the face of Williams.
"Wriggling, are you?  All right.  You had a special
reason for wanting to meet Slosson, and now you say he's
a good man.  That's enough to show me a few things&mdash;since
I know you.  Just how much do you know?  Know
that Food Products is going bust inside of six weeks or six
days?  I want to get from under, so give me the benefit of
your advice."
</p>

<p>
Macgowan regarded his cousin with a frowning air.
</p>

<p>
"Ried, if I had your brains I'd be in Wall Street&mdash;or
the penitentiary," he said slowly and smoothly, without
offense in the words.  "You and Slosson should both be
in Indianapolis.  Should be in the investment business
there, brokerage, quite on your own hook, of course."
</p>

<p>
"So!" exclaimed Williams quietly.  "What's in your
mind, then?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing save paternal advice."
</p>

<p>
"Have you enough confidence in our ability to
underwrite the business?"
</p>

<p>
"Strictly as a matter between cousins, yes!  If done
quietly."
</p>

<p>
The two men looked at each other in silence, for a long
moment.  It was impossible to conceive what passed
between them, what unspoken comprehension, what tacit
agreement, lay in their minds.  Williams was furtively
admiring, Macgowan was blandly imperturbable.  Yet one
gathered that, no matter what comprehension might exist
between these two men, Macgowan alone held the complete
key to it.
</p>

<p>
Their talk was swiftly interrupted.
</p>

<p>
The noisy groups had become silenced and wondering,
an ominous whisper passed through the huge rooms, tongues
were stilled and hushed, only to rise again in subdued
conjecture and low talk.  Obviously, something very
untoward had happened somewhere.
</p>

<p>
To Macgowan and Williams, as they stood together, Pete
Slosson came hurriedly pushing his way.  From his face
was stripped the mask of polite amiability; that face was
dark with passion, anger and fright fought for possession
of the eyes, the mouth was clenched and desperate.
</p>

<p>
"Macgowan, Armstrong wants you in Deming's library
right away," he said in a low tone.  "You too, Ried!
There's the devil to pay.  The wedding's postponed for an
hour."
</p>

<p>
Slosson shoved on into the throng, seeking some one else.
Macgowan went to the doorway with Williams.  He laid his
hand on the other's arm.
</p>

<p>
"My dear Ried," he said quietly, "you predicted that
something would happen within six weeks or six days.
Decidedly, you must overcome this habit of making
inaccurate statements!"
</p>

<p>
"Eh?"  Williams looked bewildered.  "You&mdash;what
d'you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"You should have said, within six minutes."  Macgowan
chuckled again, then halted.  "Here!  Where's the
library?  You're not going upstairs!"
</p>

<p>
"It's up there," answered the other curtly, leading the
way.
</p>

<p>
A hum of suppressed voices followed and surrounded
the two men as they mounted to the upper floor.  At this
moment, one of the upper hall doors opened, and the white-clad
figure of Dorothy burst out into the hall with excited
words.
</p>

<p>
"I must find father at once!" she was exclaiming.  "A
whole hour&mdash;why, it's terrible!  I don't care what the
reason is&mdash;oh, Mr. Macgowan!  Where is Reese?  Where's
father?"
</p>

<p>
Macgowan looked down into the flushed and beautiful
face of the girl; he gently and reassuringly patted the hand
that had caught at his arm.
</p>

<p>
"Your father has had some bad news," he said quietly.
</p>

<p>
"Bad news!"  The eyes of Dorothy widened on his.
"But how&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"A business matter."  Macgowan glanced at the others
crowding around, then with a quiet gesture he led Dorothy
to that same window-nook where they had been talking a
few moments previously.  A subdued exultation was in
his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Now, my dear girl, accept the matter calmly," he said.
"Do not interfere; there is an important meeting in your
father's library.  Let Reese have his way, I beg of you."
</p>

<p>
Dorothy caught her breath.
</p>

<p>
"It is Reese who has postponed the wedding?" she said.
</p>

<p>
"For business that could not wait."  Macgowan nodded,
and lowered his voice.  "You recall what I warned you
about?  Well, this shows.  Reese is going to take your
father's business away from him, for his own sake.  It
has to be done.  Consolidated will profit by it, of course.
Don't mention this to any one, even to your mother.  It's
been all cut and dried for some time.  I'm sorry.  Don't
blame Reese; cure him."
</p>

<p>
He turned and went his way after Williams.
</p>

<p>
Dorothy stood motionless, as though his words had
stricken something far inside of her.  Her mother
appeared, her bridesmaids crowded about with wondering
exclamations, questions, perturbed faces.  A babel of voices
surrounded them.
</p>

<p>
"It's nothing," said Dorothy, calmly enough, though her
voice was strained.  "A little matter of business that came
up unexpectedly.  Father and Reese have had to hold a
meeting.  Mother, I think I'll sit down for a minute&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She passed through them, went to her own room, closed
the door.  Then she sank down on the bed, a sudden fierce
anger filling her blue eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Why did he say that?" she murmured.  "A lie&mdash;a lie!
And the venom in his eyes&mdash;oh, I can't forget his eyes!
He hates me because I've come between him and Reese.
He hates me, and now he tells me this awful lie, tries to
make trouble between us!  He can't.  I'll not believe him.
I'll pay no attention to him&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Her emotion culminated in a burst of tears.  It never
really occurred to her for a moment that the lie might have
held any grain of truth.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER II
</h3>

<p>
Upon the issue of this meeting in the library of
Fortescue Deming there directly depended
larger things than any of the men present might
guess.  "Food Products," otherwise the Deming Food
Products Company, was an old and honorable concern with
large mills which turned out all manner of delectables from
raw flour to breakfast foods.  The men who directed the
destinies of this company now sat about the library table
of their president, wondering what the devil Reese
Armstrong and his lawyer were doing here.
</p>

<p>
Armstrong actually had a better comprehension of the
company and its situation than anybody could have
dreamed.  The summons from Deming had caught him
while dressing, and he was in his shirt sleeves; but his
manner lacked the nervous anxiety of the others about him.
They feared the blow that was about to fall, and dreaded
its consequences.  Armstrong could have told them exactly
what was going to happen to Food Products and to them,
within the next few moments.  He did not know, however,
just what the result of all this was going to be to
himself.
</p>

<p>
Lawrence Macgowan alone might have told him that.
</p>

<p>
It was now more than a year since Reese Armstrong
turned up in New York, quite unknown to fame.  He was
armed with some money, which he had made at various
points between Manitoba and Evansville, and a lawyer's
education; with a firm conviction in his own ability; and
with a project for extracting the hoard from the well-known
but mythical sock of the small investor.  He had more than
a project to this end; he had a positive genius, which he
was quite willing to demonstrate.
</p>

<p>
Despite his age, which was still short of thirty, this
genius found him a welcome.  It was a cautious welcome;
still, those who dream eternally of extracting that hoard
from that sock would welcome Mephisto himself if he were
to present himself for the purpose.
</p>

<p>
Armstrong was no Mephisto.  He possessed qualities
which did not appear on the surface.  To the metropolitan
eye, he was a green lawyer from the verdant West, who
might possibly get somewhere.  Yet, in reality, he had
behind him the culminative and driving power of struggle.
</p>

<p>
He had worked himself through law school by the unusual
method of playing the Italian harp, and playing it
well.  Farther back were two generations of Baptist
circuit-riders, whose chief heritage to him was a stern and
rigid standard of moral values, so far as his personal
conduct was concerned, and an old-fashioned belief in legal
ethics.  Now, to play the harp one must be an idealist.
To cherish a moral code, entails a sense of personal
responsibility.  These two qualities are rarely combined in
one person; when the combination does appear, that person
is either famous or infamous&mdash;he is never mediocre.
</p>

<p>
Besides all this, Armstrong had knocked about through
Western Canada, thereby attaining to an extensive
knowledge of his fellow man which did not appear in his
ruddy and ingenuous countenance.  He was blond and
vigorous, with an eye whose peculiar steely acuity could be
very disconcerting.  A laugh came often to his lips, a smile
rarely.  His air was one of poise and confidence, of almost
challenging assurance, and he had a knack of imparting
this assurance to those who came into touch with him.
</p>

<p>
It is well known that the aforesaid metropolitan eye
accepts a man at face value.  This face value of Reese
Armstrong was countersigned by a clean, alert, inspiring
brain; it was untouched by the corroding fingers of greed
or self-indulgence or crafty brooding.  One instinctively
perceived that this man held his given word above any
minted pledge.
</p>

<p>
Armstrong had sought a letter of introduction to the best
corporation lawyer in New York, and this letter brought
him to Lawrence Macgowan.
</p>

<p>
After listening to all that Armstrong had to say,
Macgowan took action.  He put up Reese Armstrong at the
Lawyers' Club, obtained a hearing from certain men of
his acquaintance&mdash;and Consolidated Securities was
incorporated.  Armstrong held no office but retained a
controlling interest.  Macgowan became a director and
remained as counsel.  The other men, of whom Judge
Holcomb and Findlater were the most prominent, became
directors without salary, being paid outright in stock for
their support.  The first subsidiary was the Armstrong
Company, purely a stock-selling concern.
</p>

<p>
Not blinded by this success, Armstrong knew that he
was only on trial.  None of these men had great confidence
in his scheme.  They were willing to take a chance, hoping
that some day would appear Fortunatus, to loose for them
the string that bound the sock of the small investor.
Armstrong, to prove that he was the man, went to work.
</p>

<p>
About himself Armstrong gathered men devoted to him,
an organization covering New York and adjacent cities.
His chief helper was Jimmy Wren&mdash;impulsive, ardent,
imaginative; not a half-way man.  Somehow, into all these
men Armstrong injected his own personality; or, perhaps,
he picked them with extraordinary skill.  In any event, he
accomplished a miracle.  Through them he reached out and
touched the small investor, became acquainted with him,
won his confidence, induced him to become part owner of
Consolidated.
</p>

<p>
From its inception the struggle was aureated with
success.  Two small manufacturing concerns were taken
over, reorganized, placed on a paying basis.  Here again
Armstrong showed his value as a judge of men.  Consolidated
Securities became a material fact, and prospered, and
was ready to reach out anew.
</p>

<p>
At the end of the year's work, Armstrong went to Evansville
to claim his bride.
</p>

<p>
He had met Dorothy Deming in New York, renewing an
old acquaintance begun two years before in Evansville,
and now upleaped between them a swift and spontaneous
mutual knowledge that they were one.  Almost from the
first there was a complete comprehension, a deep and
terrible kinship of spirit which, had there been barriers,
would have borne them down.  But there were no barriers
to this love, save Armstrong's ambition for what he deemed
final success; and this success came swiftly&mdash;all too swiftly,
some said.
</p>

<p>
And now Armstrong, shirt-sleeved, sat at the library
table of J. Fortescue Deming.
</p>

<p>
As he glanced at the faces around him, Armstrong
awaited quietly the coming event.  He knew as well as
they&mdash;perhaps better&mdash;what to expect, but he had not imagined
that it would come just yet, above all at this day and hour.
Yet during the past few months he had seen it approach,
with an inevitable certainty, nor could he hinder it.  One
does not, unfortunately, extend warnings of failure to a
prospective father-in-law; not, at least, with any great
success.  Armstrong had refused to endanger his state of
blessedness by attempting to pry open the lids of a blind
man.
</p>

<p>
As he looked around, Armstrong could not repress, did
not try to repress, the cold gleam in his eye.  For the
broken Deming who stood beside him fingering a telegram,
he could feel pity; the others deserved no such feeling.
They were either spoilers, or complacently inefficient fools,
these men.  All seven of them had together wrecked the
Deming Food Products Company, though their work in
this direction had not been by intent, but through folly,
selfish calculation, through lack of all vision beyond
self-interest.  Deming, who had built up the old company, had
lost his once strong grip on things, and his vision had
overpowered his common sense.  Although he could not realize
it, he was not without his share of blame for this debacle.
</p>

<p>
And while Armstrong thus looked with unveiled scorn
from man to man about the table, Lawrence Macgowan, by
himself in one corner of the library, watched only
Armstrong.  If his gaze held any expression, it was hidden.
</p>

<p>
"Gentlemen," began Deming, with shaking voice, "I
have hurriedly called you here to receive bad news.  To
get this message at such a moment is more than a blow to
me; it is a humiliation.  Yet I must face it."
</p>

<p>
He paused, his gaze sweeping the circle of faces.  In
them he read not the slightest hint of fortitude or
sympathy; only weakness, fright, panicky comprehension.
A single strong, calm pair of eyes might have bucked him
up in this moment.  He found none, save Armstrong's.
</p>

<p>
"This telegram," he blurted desperately, "is from the
Northwestern Millers Corporation.  Unless they receive ten
thousand dollars to apply on our account before noon
to-morrow, their attorneys are instructed to apply for a
receiver and&mdash;and&mdash;"  He paused, then went on.  "My
friends, I need not say that unless we wire this money, the
Deming Company is a thing of the past.  I ask your help."
</p>

<p>
Deming somehow fumbled himself into a chair, become
an old man in ten minutes.
</p>

<p>
About the table reigned silence.  Men looked one at
another and dared not speak.  Ried Williams, with a slight
shrug, lighted a cigarette; his sallow features were very
cynical.  Slosson stared at Deming, at Armstrong, with
surly anger in his eyes.  One would have said that he hated
this man for whom he worked, this man whose daughter he
had failed to win, and the other man in shirt-sleeves who
had won her.
</p>

<p>
Armstrong read that gaze, and smiled at the fright, the
anger, the bitter venom, of it.  Never did it enter his head
that this Slosson was to be feared, or even remembered.
Already his mind was turning upon other matters.
</p>

<p>
"Will nobody&mdash;"  Deming looked up.  The words
faltered on his tongue, and died away.  One or two of his
directors shuffled uneasy feet, cleared their throats.  No
one replied.
</p>

<p>
Then Armstrong, pushing back his chair, rose to his feet.
</p>

<p>
A flash of vigor shook Deming.  The man leaped up,
held out his hand in restraint, and found passionate, eager
words of protest.
</p>

<p>
"Not you, Reese!"  His voice came like the snapping of
a taut cord.  "Not you!  I did not summon you here
for&mdash;to ask your charity!  Now that you know the worst, I
release you on Dorothy's behalf.  You shall not marry the
daughter of a pauper, a man who has not a cent, a man
facing bankruptcy&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Be quiet, please," said Armstrong.  Under his calm
gaze, Deming's voice died again, and Deming stared at him,
wondering, agonized, breathing hard.
</p>

<p>
"Don't intrude personalities into this; you cannot realize
what your words portend," said Armstrong in that same
level, quiet tone.  "If you or any other man tries to come
between me and Dorothy, he'll be set aside.  Do you think
I'm marrying for money?  Do you think I give a tinker's
damn whether you're rich or poor, an honest man or a
thief&mdash;except for Dorothy's sake?  Sit down and listen to me.
I'm not talking charity.  I'm talking business."
</p>

<p>
Deming dropped once more into his chair, an old man
again.  He shaded his eyes with his hand, and his fingers
trembled.  No one regarded him; every eye was now
fastened upon Armstrong.
</p>

<p>
"I've very little time to talk with you, gentlemen," said
the latter crisply.  "More important matters await me
downstairs and I want no arguments.  I will make a
proposal which you may either accept or refuse.  I make
it, understand, purely as a business proposition."
</p>

<p>
"Then you'll lend us the ten thousand?" asked a
hopeful voice.
</p>

<p>
"I will not," said Armstrong.  "Rather, I cannot."
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean, then?"
</p>

<p>
Armstrong stood silent a moment.  This brief silence
emphasized his dominance; every man there was listening
intently for his proposal.  When it came, it held an
unspeakable bitterness.
</p>

<p>
"Gentlemen, we meet downstairs upon a social plane, but
here I speak to you as a business man, without the least
personal animas.  I'll not lend this money for the same
reason that no bank will lend it, for the same reason that
you'll not lend it to yourselves.  Your credit is totally
exhausted.  The loan would result in nothing.
</p>

<p>
"For the past year or more," he went on inexorably,
"your company has gone from bad to worse.  It has been
made a dumping ground for wholly inefficient relatives and
friends.  Your sales department is a joke.  Your purchasing
department is topheavy with poor judgment and rotten
with graft.  Your advertising department is a byword in
the trade for doing the wrong thing at the wrong time.
Above all, your management is so absolutely hopeless that
the entire organization is affected.  I might better say,
infected."
</p>

<p>
Some of the faces about the table flushed at these words;
some turned pale.  Deming did not move, until Armstrong
uttered his final sentence.  Then a slight quiver shook the
man's shoulders.  This was a confession, an admission, a
realization.  Ruin opens the eyes that prosperity has
blinded.
</p>

<p>
Slosson, who was assistant general manager, leaped to his
feet in a blaze of anger.
</p>

<p>
"You lie, when you say we've dumped worthless men&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Let me prove it," cut in the inflexible voice of
Armstrong.  "Two months ago, Mr. Slosson, you put two of
your relatives at the head of the rolled oats department.
One of those men was an accountant to whom no bonding
house would furnish bond.  The other had been a railroad
clerk until you gave him a position of authority.  Will
you kindly sit down and let me finish, or do you wish
further evidence?"
</p>

<p>
Slosson, rendered inarticulate by mingled fury and fear,
sat down.  Armstrong's minute knowledge came as a
shock; it terrorized him, appalled him.  Other men about
the table showed how deeply they, too, were disconcerted.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Williams," proceeded Armstrong calmly, "I
believe you are the treasurer of Food Products.  I understand
that you recently obtained licenses from some thirty
states to market under the blue sky law an issue of
preferred stock to the amount of half a million.  Is this
correct?"
</p>

<p>
"That&mdash;why, yes, it is!" stammered Ried Williams.
"That's so, Armstrong.  We've had no opportunity to
market the stock, of course; arrangements haven't been
made.  In the present condition of industrial depression, it
is very hard to market&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," said Armstrong incisively.  "Gentlemen,
I propose to find this ten thousand dollars which you need
urgently, on the following terms: The assets of your
company will be appraised, and within thirty days your
company will be purchased upon an appraised and agreed
basis, by Consolidated Securities, who will thereafter own
the business.  I will require, on behalf of the Armstrong
Company, a contract to act as your fiscal agent and to
market this stock issue of yours.
</p>

<p>
"As a preliminary to this purchase of your company, I
demand the resignation of the entire management and
directorate of Food Products, in favor of men to be
nominated by Consolidated; this to take effect within three
days.  Mr. Deming will remain as president, but without
power to interfere in the management of the business.
None other of the present officers will remain.  Should you
refuse this proposal, there is no alternative."
</p>

<p>
Armstrong sat down.
</p>

<p>
A silence of dismayed consternation, of incredulity
pervaded by anger, greeted his words.  Deming was the
only man who seemed to make no mental protest.  Wearily
passing a hand across his brow, Deming looked up.
</p>

<p>
"Reese, you don't know just how badly involved the
company is&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I do&mdash;and I know something you don't know.  Your
books show a hundred and fifty thousand in assets which
are either padded or outright false, but which Consolidated
will accept.  In justice to our own stockholders, we shall
write off these worthless assets at once.  We are prepared
to face this loss without demur."
</p>

<p>
A moment's pause.  This revelation struck absolute fear
into some of those present.  Then some one spoke up
roughly:
</p>

<p>
"How the hell do we know your company will do all this?
Findlater is president of it, not you.  How do we know
Consolidated Securities will back you up?"
</p>

<p>
For the first time, the cold poise of Armstrong's features
was broken.  The faintest shadow of a smile curved his
lips.
</p>

<p>
"Because," he answered, "I am Consolidated Securities."
</p>

<p>
A chuckle from Macgowan's corner gave this statement
emphatic endorsement.  That chuckle reached every man
present.  It dismayed them afresh, startled them, struck a
chill into their very souls.  Their faces contracted in
furious anger, only to become impotent and vacant again.
They were powerless to help themselves, to resent insults.
Without Armstrong's help, they faced ruin.
</p>

<p>
Armstrong glanced at his watch.
</p>

<p>
"Speak up, please," he said.  "I want a decision at once.
Yes or no?"
</p>

<p>
"You can't market that stock!" broke out Ried Williams,
a desperate gleam in his dark and crafty eyes.  "Several
companies have turned it down!"
</p>

<p>
"I'm not asking you to talk, but to vote," said Armstrong
coldly.  "If I contract to market that stock, it'll be
done.  Yes or no, Mr. Williams?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Williams, speaking like a man of wood.
</p>

<p>
"And you, Mr. Slosson?"
</p>

<p>
Slosson glared, flushed, swallowed hard&mdash;nodded assent.
So it went, with no dissenting voice, and came at last to
Deming.  He rose suddenly to his feet, his hand extended.
</p>

<p>
"God bless you, Reese!  Do it if you can, and thanks
for your thought of me.  But I'll not remain in the
company.  I've lost my grip of late years.  I'll get out
entirely, with whatever can be saved from the wreck.  And
for what you're doing&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I'm doing nothing," said Armstrong quietly.  "Since
this matter is now settled, I suggest that the meeting be
adjourned until to-night at eight o'clock.  Mr. Macgowan
will represent me in all future negotiations."
</p>

<p>
"What about this loan?" Deming caught up the
telegram.  "It demands the cash&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Armstrong nodded.  "I'll have to borrow the money
from Consolidated.  Can you offer any security?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing but notes," said Deming.  "Will our paper
for twenty-five thousand do?"
</p>

<p>
At this, the face of Lawrence Macgowan lighted suddenly,
as though some unexpected exultation had flashed into the
man's soul.  Armstrong turned to him.
</p>

<p>
"Certainly.  Lawrence, will you be good enough to
attend to it?  I'll sign a check at once.  Obtain the money
for me from Consolidated, and turn over the securities to
Consolidated&mdash;the loan will be to the Armstrong Company.
Mr. Williams can wire these people that a check is in the
mails, and can send along my check.  I believe you have
all the papers necessary to settle things to-night with these
gentlemen?"
</p>

<p>
Macgowan assented with a nod.  Armstrong was turning
from the table when up before him sprang Pete Slosson.
The latter's face was livid with anger and wild suspicion.
</p>

<p>
"By the lord, Armstrong, I believe you had this all
framed up!" shouted Slosson, his fist banging the table.
"Did you and Macgowan come here meaning to take over
this company?  Did you have the damnable nerve to do
this?"
</p>

<p>
Armstrong, regarding him coldly, made a slight gesture
of assent.
</p>

<p>
"Certainly I did," he said.  "I had not foreseen that
the emergency had come to-day, but was prepared."  He
turned to Deming.  "I had intended leaving Macgowan to
talk things over with you and present this course as a
future means of saving Food Products.  Since this crisis
has turned up to-day, I took occasion to present it myself.
If you would prefer that I leave your company alone&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Deming flushed, and took the arm of the younger man.
</p>

<p>
"Reese, you're worth all of us," he said simply.  "If
you can save my business reputation, let the rest go!  Now,
gentlemen, business is over; our guests await us downstairs.
Suppose we return to a social status and account
this meeting adjourned until to-night.  I am sure that
Mr. Macgowan will handle matters acceptably."
</p>

<p>
"He will," assented Armstrong, and left the room with
Deming.
</p>

<p>
Chairs scraped back and men came to their feet, following.
Macgowan, making some notes, and writing out the
check for Williams, was the last to depart.  At the door, he
overtook Ried Williams, and put his hand on the arm of
his cousin.
</p>

<p>
"I'll have Reese sign this check right away.  Ried, we
have just witnessed a very interesting psychological
study&mdash;the intolerance of a young man.  You observed it?"
</p>

<p>
Williams frowned.  "You mean&mdash;Slosson?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't mean Slosson.  I mean the young Napoleon
who issued his dicta and made those dicta obeyed.  That is
the vice of the young, Ried; to lack sufferance of the errors
that others make.  In a young man, intolerance is a natural
inheritance; in an older man, it is an unpardonable fault."
</p>

<p>
The sallow features of Williams flushed a little.
</p>

<p>
"He talked to us as though we were&mdash;niggers!" he
rasped.  The clasp of Macgowan's fingers tightened
slightly on his arm.
</p>

<p>
"Exactly, my dear Ried," came the smooth accents.
"But remember, he is a young man!  His education is not
yet finished."
</p>

<p>
With this cryptic remark, Macgowan hurried off to join
the groom, leaving Williams to stare after him in frowning
surmise.

CHAPTER III
</h3>

<p>
Dorothy glanced up from the letter which she
was eagerly devouring.
</p>

<p>
"Father writes that the company is completely
reorganized and that he's retiring for good&mdash;and, Reese, he
says to thank you for everything!  Were things so bad
as that?"
</p>

<p>
"Worse," said Armstrong laconically, then smiled as his
wife's fingers crept into his.
</p>

<p>
This man, to whose lips a smile came so rarely, had of a
sudden become a boy again, laughing from morning to
night, adoring his bride with a strangely fearful veneration
yet partaking with her in a joyous and exhilarating
zest, a gayety unabashed and unashamed, a sheer reckless
enjoyment of youth and life&mdash;and partnership.
</p>

<p>
Partnership, that was it!  That was the mystery, oldest
of the world's life, before which men and women fall down
and worship in prayer and joyous laughter and exalted
fear, the mystery wherein two becomes as one, one in faith
and hope and tears and laughter, one for better or for
worse; and each of them knowing with a deliberate surety
that though all the sky crash down in ruin, there remains to
welcome them one soul who cannot falter or fail&mdash;past life,
past death, into hell or heaven itself.
</p>

<p>
It is not every couple, however, who perceive this sort of
thing in marriage.
</p>

<p>
The honeymoon was ten days gone.  Another four days
and New York would loom up ahead, and the deep, far-flung
line of the future's horizon would begin to circumscribe
things and events and destiny for these two.  Now,
however, was no thought of the future.  Around them hung
the crisp, odorous freshness of the Carolina air; the long
yellow hills with their furred throats of piney woods lifted
into the sky and sang under the winds, and over the reaches
of yellow sand, of creamy adobe mud, of desolate green-tinged
hills, there was no hint that the summer had gone
again and the days were shortening.
</p>

<p>
Dorothy laid aside her letter and looked up.
</p>

<p>
"That telegram, Reese?  Was it anything important?"
</p>

<p>
"From Macgowan, dear.  All arrangements have been
made, and on the first of the month Food Products passes
into our hands.  The stock-selling campaign will start
moving just as soon as I get back to New York and take
things in hand.  I think I'll spread this stock out over the
whole country."
</p>

<p>
"Are you in a hurry to reach New York?"
</p>

<p>
Armstrong laughed, and pressed her fingers in his.
</p>

<p>
"Not a bit of it!  From this day forth, lady, business
comes second in my young life.  For your sake, business
is necessary; I'm going to give you the best there is in life,
and to do that I make use of business.  And I like it, too."
</p>

<p>
"You'll keep it your servant, dear?"
</p>

<p>
"You bet!  Afraid you'll have a rival?"  Armstrong
caught her hand to his lips.  "Never!  By this hand I
swear it!"
</p>

<p>
"Don't be silly&mdash;oh, be as silly as you like; I love you!"  She
broke into a clear trill of laughter.  Then she sobered,
and gave him a swift, grave look.  "Tell me something,
Reese.  The day we were married&mdash;that meeting in father's
library!  Was it because of some emergency in his affairs
that the wedding was delayed?"
</p>

<p>
Armstrong nodded.  He had meant to speak of this
before, but no opportunity had arisen.
</p>

<p>
"Sure, Dot.  You may as well know that your father's
business was in bad shape.  Those fellows who were
running things, Williams, and the rest, were heading to a
smash&mdash;and the crisis happened to come that day.  It's
all over with, thank heaven!  We've chucked 'em out and
will run the business right."
</p>

<p>
"You're not going back to Evansville to manage it?"
</p>

<p>
Armstrong's gaze came to her suddenly, as he searched
for the meaning behind her words.
</p>

<p>
"Listen, Dot; are we partners?"
</p>

<p>
"In everything, my dear.  Why?"
</p>

<p>
"Then in business as in other things.  Good!  If Food
Products had not been taken over by Consolidated, it would
now be out of existence; we saved it from bankruptcy, and
we'll make money by it.  In order to keep faith with the
stockholders, in order to let your father come clear and
leave everything square and fair behind him, we have to
dig pretty deep; some of the assets must be totally written
off.  Ultimately the company will be a good investment,
but it won't be any exclusive affair for me, lady.
</p>

<p>
"You see, it's one of several companies owned and run
by Consolidated&mdash;which is under my control.  I can't
attend to any one of these companies myself; I pay other
men to do that.  I attend to the loan and financing business,
the stock-selling campaigns, which formed the prime object
of Consolidated.  So, you see, if I leave New York&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Her hand fluttered swiftly over his mouth.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't mean that at all!" she exclaimed.  "I go with
you, my dear, not you with me!  I'm not trying to get you
back to Evansville, although of course I love it there.  But,
Reese, father's whole life has been bound up in Food Products;
he was proud of it, proud to have the company carry
his name, proud of its past!  Was it necessary for him to
leave the company?"
</p>

<p>
Armstrong was startled by some undertone of her voice.
For a moment he met her grave, steady gaze; he wondered
what thoughts were stirring behind those eyes of brilliant,
steely blue, which could so quickly change to a deeper
violet.
</p>

<p>
And again, he wondered at the clear beauty of her&mdash;beauty
of golden hair, of skin like pink-and-white coral,
beauty of thought and soul within.  It brought an ache
into his heart, an ache of sheer sweet joy that this woman
had found him worthy of her.  He must never fail her&mdash;ah!
And if he did?
</p>

<p>
At least, she would never fail him.
</p>

<p>
Armstrong was smiling at this thought, when her words
recurred to him and his brain darted upon the answer.
Perhaps it was telepathy, for he reached down and took the
letter from her lap.  A newspaper clipping came into his
fingers.  Intuition had guided him aright.
</p>

<p>
He read the clipping thoughtfully:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"It is with great regret that we announce the retirement of
J. Fortescue Deming from the active management of the Deming
Food Products Company.  To many this announcement will
come as a shock.  For a generation past, the name of J. Fortescue
Deming has been identified with the growth of Evansville&mdash;"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Armstrong's brow creased slightly as he read on, but he
made no comment.  Then he picked up the letter, asked
permission with a glance, and Dorothy nodded.  He read
very carefully what Deming had written, and folded up
the letter again.
</p>

<p>
"Dot," he said slowly, "surely you don't believe that
your father cherishes any resentment because&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Why&mdash;Reese!" she broke out impulsively.  "Can you
voice such a thought, after what he wrote there?  Doesn't
every word of that letter show that he thinks you splendid
and generous, that he feels toward you only the warmest
gratitude and appreciation?  Don't be silly!"
</p>

<p>
"The letter and the newspaper clipping are two very
different things, my dear," said Armstrong drily.  "I
wanted your father to remain in the company as titular
president, <i>causa honoris</i>; he refused.  I could not offer
him control of the company, of course&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Listen to me, dear boy!"  Dorothy compelled his eyes
to hers, and he found them very grave and earnest.  "Get
it out of your foolish head, now and forever, that father
could feel anything but the deepest gratitude&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"It's not in my head," broke in Armstrong soberly.
"It's in yours, I'm afraid."
</p>

<p>
"It's not!  Why, the last thing before we left home
that day, father&mdash;well, he wasn't there when I said good-by,
and I found him upstairs, all by himself; and, Reese, he
was praying&mdash;for us&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She broke off for a moment, struggling with swift-starting
tears.
</p>

<p>
"He spoke of you, Reese; he was happy, happy!  I've
never seen him so happy that I can remember.  It seemed
that a load was gone from him.  And whenever I've
thought of how he spoke and what he said of you, it's
made me very humble to think that you were mine, my
husband&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Armstrong drew her to him, and their lips met.  His
stab of disturbing fear was quite gone; gladness surged
through him and faith, and wonder at the woman who was
his.
</p>

<p>
Even the austere Cæsar, men say, once was young.
</p>

<p>
Later that day, Reese Armstrong sat in the hotel lobby,
before a glowing pyre of logs that swept the afternoon
chill out of the air.  He was alone, for Dorothy was answering
her father's letter.  As he stared into the flicker of
the flames and thought once more of that newspaper clipping,
he felt a lingering doubt.  Somehow it spelled evil
to him.
</p>

<p>
The tone of it, the unworded, tacit insinuation of it,
held a barb that stung him deeply.  He could see how the
impression might go forth that he had forced Deming
out of Food Products and had grabbed the company.
That was not true; yet here lay the hint, very cleverly
written.
</p>

<p>
"And written with intent, or I'm a Dutchman!" thought
Armstrong.
</p>

<p>
He had not far to seek for enemies; the former directorate
of Food Products hated him bitterly enough.  He had
himself to blame for this, since he had not hidden his
scorn and despite of them; he realized now the insolence
of his own manner.  They would have preferred to let
the company crash, rather than be saved by him&mdash;but their
pride had given way before their selfish interests.  No
doubt one of them had been behind the publication of this
innuendo in a local newspaper.  Williams, it might be;
that sallow, crafty scoundrel was the sort to do such a
thing.
</p>

<p>
Armstrong did not know that Williams and Macgowan
were cousins.  Few people did know it.
</p>

<p>
The fact that this innuendo had come in Dorothy's letter
from her father, hurt; though of course Deming had not
perceived the hint in the clipping.  Further, Armstrong
was not unmindful of a slight rift within the Consolidated
lute.  Findlater, his nominal president, was taking a new
and active interest in the company's affairs.
</p>

<p>
Findlater, like the other directors, was a figurehead.
They had been paid flatly in stock and drew no salaries.
With former bank connections, Findlater had been valuable
to Armstrong, and was paid for that value.  Now, finding
that Consolidated was a big thing, Findlater was prying
about and about, intruding here and there, sniffing like
a dog on the scent of game.  Armstrong's lip curled at
the thought of Findlater, whom he had come to dislike
cordially.
</p>

<p>
"He and the rest&mdash;all of 'em on the scent, except Macgowan,"
he reflected.  "Looking for pickings!  Well, they
backed me, but I have the control.  Consolidated is
making money, they're making money, and our investors are
making money.  I wonder if this sly thrust from
Evansville could have any throwback to Findlater and his
crowd?"
</p>

<p>
He thought of wiring Macgowan to look into this, and
decided in the negative.  Mac need not be troubled with
such petty things.  This was only some little spite-work,
not worth attention.  Besides, Findlater as yet knew nothing
about the inside of the Food Products affair.  That lay
between Armstrong and Macgowan and Jimmy Wren
alone.
</p>

<p>
Macgowan!  There was a man for you!  Armstrong's
face warmed at the bare thought of his friend.  Only
Macgowan, from the start, had gone into Consolidated with
a firm and unshaken faith.  Only Macgowan had fought
past one crisis after another with all the power of his keen
intellect.  Only Macgowan had forced those other men to
stay in line behind Armstrong.
</p>

<p>
Macgowan had seen the value of that queer and
extraordinary idea which Armstrong brought with him to New
York.  The old notion of finance as a war, said Armstrong,
had seen its day and was doomed.  It was purely an Old
Testament teaching, wherein one side was victor, the other
side vanquished; it was a preachment of conquest, of
destruction without compromise&mdash;of spoils.  It was a
doctrine of loot, and in the new world of to-day this old
doctrine was as dead as Moses.
</p>

<p>
Instead, Armstrong brought forth a New Testament
ideal; that, instead of war, there should be mutual
advancement.  He preached that finance was a successful
and worth-while thing only when all parties to the
transaction were gainers.  And how they had laughed!
</p>

<p>
"A fine socialistic theory!" they said.  "Mac, how much
of a soviet retainer are you handling?  Where'd you pick
up this radical, anyhow?"
</p>

<p>
Macgowan did not laugh; he merely argued, on the
basis of Armstrong's detailed plan of operations.  When
Lawrence Macgowan argued, the gods were themselves
confounded.  In this instance, Macgowan flung himself
into the fight whole-heartedly, with amazing vigor and
energy.  One would have said that he fought for himself,
rather than for Armstrong.  Or, perhaps, he fought for
Armstrong's ideal, which he was making his own.
</p>

<p>
At all events, Macgowan won the fight.  Consolidated
went through, and Armstrong found himself secure in the
control of this holding company, free to embark upon the
larger dream.  Nor was he blind to the danger that now
threatened.  Macgowan had once or twice warned him that
Findlater had scented blood, that the other directors were
sniffing uneasily; all except old Judge Holcomb, who was
true as steel.  Jimmy Wren had perceived it, too.
</p>

<p>
Small good it would do them!  Armstrong's control was
secure.  The Armstrong Company, the selling organization
through which he reached out to those thousands of
investors, was devoted to him, was his alone.  Jimmy Wren,
its manager, held for Armstrong a dog-like trust and
affection.  The investors themselves were his; a supremely
important fact, this!  It was not the organization but
Reese Armstrong whom they trusted.
</p>

<p>
Macgowan held a block of stock in Consolidated, and
was content; he drew fees only for his services as Armstrong's
personal attorney.  In all the months of their close
fellowship, Armstrong had never known his friend to ask
an unworthy favor.  There were no relatives to be given
soft jobs.  There were no hangers-on to be handed
sinecures.  Mac stood four-square.
</p>

<p>
A few short weeks before his marriage, when first arose
this suspicion of loot-madness on the part of Findlater and
his friends, Armstrong instructed Macgowan to handle the
matter.  He himself would be busy, would be away; he had
more implicit confidence in Macgowan's ability to handle
things smoothly than in his own.
</p>

<p>
"I'll take care of it," said the attorney.  "But time has
run along since we mapped out Consolidated's scheme of
operations.  That voting trust, for example."
</p>

<p>
Armstrong reflected briefly.  At the formation of the
selling company, the Armstrong Company, he had placed
most of his common or voting stock of Consolidated
Securities in a voting trust.  Macgowan, Findlater and
Jimmy Wren, who was secretary of consolidated as well as
manager of the Armstrong Company, controlled this trust,
all shares being pooled.  Since Macgowan and Jimmy
Wren were unalterably Armstrong's spokesmen, this let
him control Consolidated without figuring too prominently
in that control.
</p>

<p>
Now, as he stared into the log fire and remembered these
things, Armstrong recalled verbatim that short
conversation with Lawrence Macgowan.
</p>

<p>
"Then the trust has expired, Mac?"
</p>

<p>
"Two weeks ago."
</p>

<p>
"Renew it&mdash;say, until the end of next March, up to but
not including the next annual meeting," directed
Armstrong.  "That leaves me free.  You and Wren can handle
anything that Findlater or his crowd may bring up.  Send
over the papers at once.  Findlater won't object?  He's
rather puffed up over his job of president, these days."
</p>

<p>
"I'd like to see him object!" said Macgowan, drily.
</p>

<p>
Thus it had been arranged.
</p>

<p>
Now, watching visions in the ruddy flames, Armstrong's
heart warmed to the thought of his friend.  Few men had
such a bar of steel at their back!  Best of all, he had not
bought Macgowan with gold.  He had bought him with
friendship, with the fairy coin of a mutual dream.
</p>

<p>
"I must be luckier than most," mused Armstrong.
"They say that a man has only one person who'll never
go back on him&mdash;his wife.  But I have two.  My wife,
and Mac."
</p>

<p>
"A penny for your thoughts!" said a laughing voice in
his ear.
</p>

<p>
Armstrong started, came to his feet, and smiled into the
eyes of Dorothy.
</p>

<p>
"It'll take something better than a penny," he retorted
gayly.
</p>

<p>
"Not here&mdash;not here in the lobby, you shameless
creature!"  Dorothy drew back hastily, her eyes dancing.
"I'll pay, and with interest!  What were you thinking
about, as you sat there smiling into the fire?"
</p>

<p>
"About you," he answered promptly.  "And how lucky
I am to have both you and a friend!  Your faith and
love, and the friendship of Lawrence Macgowan."
</p>

<p>
He fancied that a faint shadow leaped into her eyes.
The fancy was dissipated by her burst of hearty laughter.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  You should put it the other way&mdash;he's lucky to
have you for a friend!  Well, my letters are finished and
I'm ready for a walk.  Are you?"
</p>

<p>
"With you&mdash;always!  I hope everybody in sight knows
we're bride and groom!"
</p>

<p>
"They do, and I don't care a bit!  Come on."
</p>

<p>
They went out arm in arm, laughing together.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap0104"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
</h3>

<p>
There are two dreams which every developed and
normal woman cherishes.  One, of wee hands at
her breast.  The other, that she may some day
have either the building, or the complete rebuilding, of a
home; and it is always more enjoyable to correct and profit
by the mistakes of other folk than it is to make our own
mistakes.
</p>

<p>
Aircastle Point fulfilled this latter dream for Dorothy
Armstrong.
</p>

<p>
The point itself was private property, owned by the
dozen men who had their homes here; around its islands
and properties swept the sea-tides, with Long Island Sound
opening out beyond.  Lying within the corporate limits
of a town once famed as being forty-five minutes from
Broadway, Aircastle Point was both remote from the citied
roar yet near enough to New York.
</p>

<p>
When Dorothy viewed this future home of hers, the
delight that upsprang in her became a rapture, an ecstasy
of eager planning, that fully verified Armstrong's choice
of a location.  She found an old Dutch farmhouse with
wall panels, corner fireplaces and other treasures of a once
comfortable and simple home life.  On three sides, a lawn
swept down to the sea, barred by a low wall of rough stone.
Huge elms and oaks overshadowed the house, and across
the lawn were flung old cedars and pines, contorted and
blown by the salt winds into fantastic shapes.
</p>

<p>
Armstrong slyly suggested decorators, then refrained
from further intrusion.  He had certain ideas of his own,
but watched unobtrusively to see what would happen.
Thus, thinking to please him, Dorothy called in a
gentleman from Fifth Avenue, who made two very accurately
beautiful paintings of her home-interior as it should be.
Reese accompanied his wife to view the results, and blandly
expressed himself as charmed.  Dorothy eyed him, then
turned to the decorator with her sweetest air.
</p>

<p>
"These pictures are exquisite.  I should like to buy them
from you."
</p>

<p>
"You flatter us, Mrs. Armstrong!" came the unctuous
response, with the usual simper.  "We try to express an
individualistic taste, of course&mdash;this dining room, for
example.  You will notice that it is entirely correct;
Jacobean throughout.  People are doing these things so
much this season, of course!  This touch of color over the
buffet is a splendid bit of tapestry that I have in mind;
really quite good, don't you think?  An excellent bit of
still life&mdash;game&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I'm sure your ideas are excellent," said Dorothy.
"What is the price of these?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, say fifty dollars for both pictures; we do not make
a practice of selling these things, you know, and if you
decide to confide the work to us, as I am confident you will,
we shall be very glad to deduct the amount from our fee."
</p>

<p>
Dorothy paid for the two pictures.  Something in her air
aroused the decorator to questions, to an unfortunate
probing.  So Dorothy gave him the truth which he sought.
</p>

<p>
"You see," she explained sweetly, "I want them because
they are really very nice, and also in order to show what
we've escaped.  My taste in decorating is quite hopeless,
you know, for I want a home and not an inane color
effect&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Armstrong exploded in a burst of laughter and hastened
to escort Dorothy from the outraged precincts.  Safely in
the car, she turned dancing eyes to him.
</p>

<p>
"Then you don't insist on a decorator?"
</p>

<p>
"No!"
</p>

<p>
A sigh of relief, and she settled back comfortably.
</p>

<p>
"I'm so glad!  Just think of that absurd man, actually
intending to tear out all those beautiful old panels!  Reese,
I'm going to spend some money, but in three weeks we'll
have a home&mdash;a real home, too!  It was good of you to wait
and let me do it, instead of trying to surprise me with
everything done."
</p>

<p>
"Go ahead, the sky's the limit," said Armstrong, who
was hugely delighted by the whole affair.
</p>

<p>
Three weeks, in fact, saw them settled in the finished
portion of the house, while a small army of workmen still
struggled with unfinished rooms and grounds and garden,
under Dorothy's direction.
</p>

<p>
Lawrence Macgowan was the first guest to view the new
home, or rather the completed portion of it.  Armstrong
brought him down from the city over a week-end, and
eagerly displayed the grounds and house.  He was
delighted by his friend's unchecked enthusiasm and
endorsement of everything that was being done.
</p>

<p>
At dinner, Macgowan heard the story about the decorators,
and roared over it.  When they had adjourned to
the living room and were discussing Dorothy's choice of
rugs, Macgowan stood with his back to the log fire,
fingering his cigar; then he turned impulsively to Dorothy,
and spoke.
</p>

<p>
"My dear Dorothy, may I make a frank confession?"
</p>

<p>
Dorothy's smile belied the flash of steel in her glance.
"Certainly, if Reese may be a party to it!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, he's a part of it."  Macgowan chuckled, in his odd
manner of being inwardly amused over something
unspoken.  "You see, like every confirmed bachelor who
beholds his best friend embarking on the wine-dark sea of
matrimony, I have hitherto, my dear Dorothy, been
ungallant enough to congratulate you&mdash;quite irrespective of
your charming qualities&mdash;upon the acquisition of your
husband."
</p>

<p>
He paused, regarding Dorothy with his slightly aggressive,
straightforward gaze.  His air was half reflective,
half admiring.
</p>

<p>
"Well, where's the crime in that?" she demanded
brightly.  "Don't you suppose that women ever think they
are fortunate?  We're not all stuck-up prigs, grandly
convinced of the blessings we bestow&mdash;not a bit of it!"
</p>

<p>
Macgowan waved his cigar.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, but I confess my error!  It is Reese who deserves
the congratulations which I now tender with all my heart,
not with the lips alone!  Wives are easily found, my dear
fellow," turning to Armstrong, "but home-makers are
rare, I assure you.  So rare, indeed, that I&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He ended with a sigh and a gesture, as though the rarity
of home-makers accounted for his own single state.  Then,
with a sudden thrust of his cigar, he indicated the rooms
beyond.
</p>

<p>
"Look at this place!  Look at that burnt-ivory woodwork,
those rugs, these bits of polished wood that we call
furniture!  Look at those bright yellow valences, those
blue curtains, that pinkish splendor of a Kirman on the
floor!  Why, the raw fighting colors are as sweetly
harmonious, as delicately blended, as the vivid hues of some
old Chinese embroidery!  Only an artist can blend raw
colors.
</p>

<p>
"Thank the lord, there's no formality about this house.
Good things in plenty, but no useless frippery made for
effect and expenditure.  When one comes in here, it's to
find a home that's lived in, used, created for comfort and
enjoyment.  Reese, old man, you're to be congratulated!
With the cynical egotism of one who is too largely
surrounded by a world of sham, I say that I myself could
have done no better with this house.  It is perfection."
</p>

<p>
"And that's a huge compliment, Dot, for Lawrence
Macgowan to pay!" exclaimed the beaming Armstrong.
"He's a famous critic of the arts.  Everybody up and
down the Avenue looks to Mac to pass on worthy furniture,
Serbian sculpture and all the professional forms of
art!  On the strength of this compliment, you can go
into the house-decorating business and become rich in a
month."
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense, I mean it!" protested Macgowan earnestly.
"Absolutely."
</p>

<p>
"And I do thank you."  Dorothy's eyes were dancing
under the praise, yet the blue-steel gleam still lingered in
their depths.  "You make amends very pleasantly."
</p>

<p>
"Amends?" Macgowan's brows lifted.  "For what,
pray?"
</p>

<p>
"For a remark you made in Evansville, the day we were
married.  You remember?"
</p>

<p>
Macgowan regarded her, frowning slightly in puzzled
retrospection.
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid not," he said.  "Surely, it was nothing to
require amends?"
</p>

<p>
As he said this, his eyelids lowered the barest trifle.  The
movement was entirely involuntary.  So trivial was it, so
subtly evanescent, as to be almost imperceptible; only one
watching him keenly would have observed this slight
muscular reflex.
</p>

<p>
Dorothy observed it.  If she knew it for the sign of a lie,
she made no comment.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, not in the least!" she responded, a smile on her
lips.  "And I dare Reese to try dragging business into this
home and spoiling it!  Just to show that I'm not a bit
afraid of the consequences, I want to ask you two men
something about business."
</p>

<p>
Armstrong settled deeper into his chair and lighted his
cigar.
</p>

<p>
"Fire away, Dot!  Any time I don't drop business the
minute I leave the office, just you jump on me.  Want to
invest some surplus cash, or what?"
</p>

<p>
She laughed.  "No, thank you!  You can play with
other people's money all you like.  I want to ask about Food
Products, that's all&mdash;what you're doing with it.  And do
sit down, Lawrence.  You make me nervous, handling that
cigar like a baton; besides, you cut off all the beauty of
the fire."
</p>

<p>
"Cruel lady!" sighed Macgowan.  "Can you not appreciate
the magnificence of such a fire-screen?  Well, I
obey.  Reese, tell the lady all about Food Products."
</p>

<p>
He sat down, gazing at the ceiling, and puffed
reflectively at his cigar.  He appeared to be rather
thoughtful about something.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Dot?" inquired Armstrong.  "What do you
want to know?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, everything in general!  Is that stock issue on the
market?"
</p>

<p>
"We start the campaign in a couple of weeks; one thing
and another has held us up.  Our investors will eat it up,
too.  Consolidated is going to do big things for them&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Food Products, please!"  Dorothy stuck to her point.
"Is the plant at work?"
</p>

<p>
"Full capacity; it has never ceased work.  Within the
next month or two the reorganization will begin to show
big results.  We're going to work with a real advertising
campaign.  If you could see the difference between our
operating cost-sheet and that of the old organization, you'd
realize what one trouble back there has been."
</p>

<p>
"With father's company?" asked Dorothy, a little
doubtfully.
</p>

<p>
"Exactly.  By the way, Dot, I wrote your father to-day
asking him to reconsider his resignation and come back into
the company.  I think he's been out of the harness long
enough to realize that he'll rust out unless he keeps busy.
I hope he'll accept."
</p>

<p>
"Good, good!" put in Macgowan heartily.  "Glad to
hear that, Reese!  His name is worth a good deal to the
company, as is his active interest.  I don't imagine he'll
accept, though, unless he's given real powers.  This
figurehead business may not appeal to him any more now than it
did before&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Figurehead?"  Dorothy glanced from one man to the
other.  "Just what does that mean?  If he came back as
president, wouldn't he have all the powers he always had?"
</p>

<p>
Macgowan started to speak, but was forestalled.  Armstrong
suddenly sensed what was in his wife's mind, and
was startled.  He leaned forward, giving a decisive thrust
to his words.
</p>

<p>
"Dorothy, we want your father as president.  Not with
full powers, but to guide the company from a consultant
position.  I've pulled some of the best men in this country
from their jobs, to work for Food Products.  I've guaranteed
these men a free hand, no interference.  Your father
can help them tremendously with his advice, his knowledge
of the whole business; he would be an invaluable asset to
us!"
</p>

<p>
"I see," murmured Dorothy, with a nod of comprehension.
Her eyes rested for a moment on Macgowan,
then returned to Armstrong.  "Have you any idea when
the sale of this stock issue will be completed?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."  Armstrong leaned back, relaxed, satisfied that
she understood matters beyond any miscomprehension.
"Within three or four months.  The old directors failed
to accomplish anything; they could not even start the ball
rolling.  With our investors to work on, nearly sixteen
thousand of 'em, we'll put Food Products over."
</p>

<p>
"By the first of the year, eh?"  Dorothy studied him a
moment.  "Why, I thought such things took a lot of time
and work&mdash;a long campaign!"
</p>

<p>
Armstrong smiled.  "Ordinarily they do.  In this case,
our organization is all ready to fall to work when the word
comes.  Besides, your father's company had the foundations
laid; they got the blue sky licenses and so forth.
We simply step in and sell."
</p>

<p>
"I see."  Dorothy glanced again at Macgowan.  "By
the way, Lawrence, isn't Ried Williams some relation of
yours?  I think Pete Slosson spoke of it to me one day&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Macgowan's gaze dwelt upon her for a moment.  Undoubtedly,
he recognized in the casualness of this question
something beneath the surface.  Perhaps he sensed attack.
</p>

<p>
"A distant cousin or something of the sort," he responded
easily.  "Nothing to be proud of in any case; eh,
Reese?  The relationship is so vague that it's only a matter
of family mention.  By the way, what has become of those
two chaps, Williams and Slosson?  They were rather bitter
over our getting control and throwing them out.  Do you
ever hear from Pete Slosson, Dorothy?"
</p>

<p>
So nonchalant was the air of Macgowan that to Armstrong
the words conveyed nothing.  But to Dorothy they
conveyed a declaration of war.  From her wedding day,
she had sensed Lawrence Macgowan as an enemy.  She had
ceased to grope in bewilderment for the cause, and accepted
the fact itself; yet the fact did not cease to hurt.
</p>

<p>
"I can't possibly keep up with all my old flames," and
she laughed.  Then, rising, she dismissed the matter.
"Thank you for the business information, gentlemen.
Now, shall we have some music?  Reese, kindly tune up
that harp&mdash;you've hardly touched it since we were
married!"
</p>

<p>
Macgowan heartily acclaimed the suggestion.  With
Dorothy at the piano, Armstrong got his harp in shape and
they settled down for an hour of music, while Macgowan
smoked and listened with critical appreciation, or discussed
the vicissitudes of that harp.
</p>

<p>
"A man can never be known for what he really is," he
exclaimed during a pause, "until he can be observed either
at the height of fortune, or at the lowest point of disaster.
Observing you, Reese, at the summit of success, I find you
exactly the same person you were the first day you entered
my office.  Feel any different inside?"
</p>

<p>
"Not a bit."
</p>

<p>
Armstrong laughed.  Nor was he ashamed of past days,
for there was no petty snobbery in him.  He spoke gayly
of old times when his harp had boasted strings of cord or
baling-wire, <i>faute d'argent</i>; or of how he had read
Blackstone by day and troubadoured by night with his college
friends.  Far away were those days, but as he recalled
them one could see that the memory was sweet within him.
</p>

<p>
Later, when they were alone in their own room, Dorothy
came to her husband, arms out to his, and met his kiss with
gravely serious gaze.
</p>

<p>
"Reese, dear, there's one thing I want you to promise
me.  Only one; but it means more to me than I can tell
you."
</p>

<p>
"Anything in the world, dear lady," he promised,
looking into her eyes and wondering what had caused their
deep violet glow.  "Speak!  Your slave is ready."
</p>

<p>
"I'm serious.  Am I really to be your partner in
everything?"
</p>

<p>
"Not to be, but are."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I don't want you to drag business home with
you.  I want you to leave business behind and come to me
and to your home.  I don't want you to think that you
have to retail to me every bit of business complexity that
turns up.  But&mdash;dear!  I want to have a part in your
dreams.  I want you to come first to me, always, when you
conceive some great ambition.  Will you?"
</p>

<p>
"Always, dear lady!  I promise&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Wait!"  She checked him, finger on lips.  "That's not
what I want you to promise.  I want something far more
important to both of us!  I want you to promise me just
this one thing: That when some real business trouble
comes to worry you, you will bring it to me.  First to me,
ahead of your friends, ahead of your lawyers, ahead of
your business men.  Not for my poor advice, perhaps, but
just to let me share it with you first."
</p>

<p>
Armstrong, as he smiled at her, wondered why her face
was so strained and anxious.
</p>

<p>
"I promise, lady.  Why, dear&mdash;you don't think I'd take
my troubles to Mac in preference to you?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I'm jealous of course, but that has nothing to do
with it.  There's a deeper reason that I'm not going to tell
now."  Her fingers tightened on his arms, tensely earnest.
"It's a promise, now?"
</p>

<p>
"Surely, sweetheart," he said gravely.  "Why&mdash;lady!
You're crying&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Because I love you, that's all.  Kiss me!"
</p>

<p>
Armstrong, rendered more than a little uneasy by her
manner, was relieved to find that she said no more on the
subject.  He would not have been so relieved had he known
how she lay awake that night, staring into the darkness,
her brain struggling with the problem of Macgowan.
</p>

<p>
Intuition told her that the man was an enemy; she could
not forget those words of his on her wedding-day.  Against
all this balanced his friendship and help for Armstrong,
and weighed down the scales with fact.  Yet she could not
dismiss her fear of him; that it was baseless and apparently
unfounded, only served to increase her hurt and anxiety.
Still, she knew that she dare not so much as hint such a
thing to her husband.
</p>

<p>
And to Armstrong himself, who was very sensitive to
Dorothy's mental reactions, this incident recurred more
than once.  He was quite aware that marriage will seldom
endure old comradeships.  It was natural that Dorothy
should feel a twinge of jealousy; had she not frankly
admitted the fact?  Down there in the city, it was
Macgowan who was Armstrong's alter ego, who handled all
Armstrong's affairs, who was friend and practically
business partner as well.  So far as the city was concerned,
that was all very well.
</p>

<p>
"But I'll have to leave Mac in the city," thought
Armstrong.  "Dot is going to resent it if I bring him home too
often.  I'll bring Jimmy Wren down one of these days&mdash;he's
pure boy and hasn't any of Mac's cynical loftiness.
Dot has too many ideals to be enthralled by Mac's attitude,
maybe."
</p>

<p>
Which was all very nice, and all entirely wrong.  Like
most men, Armstrong was blind to the inner motivations
of the woman he loved.
</p>

<p>
Dorothy, seeing this, prayed that he might continue
blind&mdash;for a time.

<h3>
CHAPTER V
</h3>

<p>
Macgowan swung into Armstrong's office one
morning, bringing with him a keen breath of
late November.
</p>

<p>
"Well, how goes the sales company?" he exclaimed
breezily, flinging down his hat and coat.  "Too busy to
talk?"
</p>

<p>
"Not yet."  Armstrong dismissed his secretary and set
forth cigars.  "Everything fine."
</p>

<p>
"Sure, but let's have details.  I need 'em this
morning."  Macgowan chuckled as he surveyed his friend.  "You're
looking fit.  How's the country estate?"
</p>

<p>
"Fine.  What do you want details on&mdash;winter gardens
or sales campaign?"
</p>

<p>
"Food Products, mostly.  I'm curious to know what's
going on."
</p>

<p>
Armstrong opened a drawer of his desk and brought
forth some typed sheets.
</p>

<p>
Consolidated Securities occupied the three top floors of
a building in the late thirties, but was cramped for room.
Already Armstrong was planning the lease of an entire
building in the forties&mdash;a lease to become ownership later.
The New Year would be time enough to take that up.  For
the present, he wanted to get upon absolutely solid ground,
financially.  He had no ambition to be the center of a wild
selling drive which would go smash upon the rocks of
inflation.
</p>

<p>
His own office was quietly handsome without being ornate.
Just as he wanted the business to be out of Wall
Street and well uptown, so he wanted everything around
him to be of the best without ostentation.  The looks of a
business, like the dress of a man, have a certain definite
value; Armstrong did not make the error of either over- or
under-estimating that value.
</p>

<p>
"Food Products," he responded, "is sold.  The campaign
is going well, and it'll be a profitable campaign for
the Armstrong Company if it ends as well as it has begun.
By the way, I'm going to merge the company into
Consolidated later on.  It's a bit loose; too much my own
affair.  I want everything in Consolidated."
</p>

<p>
"Isn't it merged enough now to suit you?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  At present, I could draw the Armstrong Company
out bodily, and I'm going to change that&mdash;say, next spring,
after the annual meeting of Consolidated.  But never mind
that now.  I have another and more immediate change
afoot.  I've determined to keep Food Products in the
hands of our own original investors in this part of the
country.  The stock-selling organization is spread too far
out."
</p>

<p>
"Isn't it doing the work?" Macgowan frowned slightly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  But, Mac, do you realize that we had to dig
deep in writing off those worthless assets?  I want to save
money."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and that hurt."  Macgowan chuckled.  "Findlater
was moaning about it the other day.  Asked why we
hadn't let those assets ride for a while."
</p>

<p>
Armstrong's eyes chilled, as they usually did at mention
of Findlater.
</p>

<p>
"You told him?"
</p>

<p>
"That we were too cursed honest; or rather, you.  If
I'd been in your shoes, I'd have been tempted to do
otherwise."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, you would!"  Armstrong laughed.  "You old
rascal, you'd have been the first one to come clean!  But
see here, Mac.  I'm cutting down my organization.  I'm
going to eliminate all the Pacific Coast, everything west of
the Mississippi, in fact."
</p>

<p>
The broad, finely chiseled features of Macgowan underwent
a certain change at this information&mdash;so decided a
change that Armstrong wondered.  For an instant he
fancied that those piercingly aggressive eyes bored into
him with a look bordering on suspicion.
</p>

<p>
"What the devil!" ejaculated the lawyer.  "Why, only
last week you spoke of branching out farther!"
</p>

<p>
Armstrong leaned back and drew at his cigar.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but that was last week.  Most of our old investors
are here in the East, scattered between here and Chicago.
Over fifteen thousand of 'em.  Our schedule of operation
is airtight.  Consolidated, for example, owns Food Products,
pockets some of the commission for selling the stock, profits
by the operation of the company&mdash;and it all comes back to
the investors.  And our corporate funds are growing fast."
</p>

<p>
"Then what's to hinder the spread?" asked Macgowan,
teeth clamped on cigar.
</p>

<p>
"Too much expense."  Armstrong puffed thoughtfully.
"We don't want to splurge, to go after the whole country
and over-reach ourselves.  I don't want to be classed with
these birds who flood the country with stock not worth half
its price.  For next year, we'll play safe with what we
have.  We can lay out a big program, but hold back
with it."
</p>

<p>
"You're selling stock on the coast now," argued
Macgowan.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but only a small allotment of Food Products is
being handled there."  Armstrong became crisp, decisive,
closed to all protest.  "I'm writing our men out there
to-day, calling them in by the first of the year.  The less
they sell of Food Products out there, the better pleased I'll
be; but if they can get rid of their allotment next month,
all right."
</p>

<p>
Behind his veil of gray smoke, Macgowan's brilliant,
arrogant eyes narrowed in reflection.  One would have
thought that this change of program on Armstrong's part,
instead of being a mere detail of organization, was
something that affected him vitally.  Even Armstrong was
mildly surprised that Macgowan should be so interested in
this detail.
</p>

<p>
"You see, Mac," he explained, "I'm going to cut down
all expenses.  Food Products is the biggest thing we've
taken over, and I'm getting stingy.  The time to retrench
is before the pinch comes.  Some day, trouble will hit us;
when it hits, I want the organization as compact and
impervious as possible, and funds all in shape.  We have
competitors and&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The lawyer threw up his hands.
</p>

<p>
"You're right, Reese, dead right!  I suppose I'm like
the others; a bit hypnotized by our success and the size of
the bankroll.  Then you'll not draw in your horns before
the first of the year?"
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
Macgowan puffed for a moment in silence, nodding
thoughtfully.  Then he glanced up.
</p>

<p>
"You know there's a meeting of the Consolidated
directors next week.  Instruct me about that note of
yours&mdash;whether to renew or take it up."
</p>

<p>
"What note?"
</p>

<p>
"Covered by the twenty-five thousand in Food Products'
paper.  You borrowed ten thousand from Consolidated, if
you remember, on behalf of the Armstrong Company, and
turned the money over to Deming."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that!"  Armstrong thought for a moment.
"Why, I'll renew the loan to Food Products for another
three months&mdash;to pay me now would rather handicap
them.  No use taking up the paper from Consolidated until
Food Products can make good.  Suppose you renew for
three months&mdash;or better make it four months.  Then Food
Products will be on its feet."
</p>

<p>
Macgowan nodded.
</p>

<p>
"I'll tell Jimmy Wren, and if Findlater objects we'll
show him who runs the voting Trust.  By the way, you
people going to be in town over Christmas, or not?"
</p>

<p>
"No, we'll be in Evansville.  Dorothy's folks are going
to Europe right after the holidays, and we'll spend
Christmas with them, then bring 'em East.  Christmas in
Evansville listens good, Mac!"  Armstrong's rare smile
leaped out.  "Real juleps, remember 'em?  And the kind
of turkey that isn't grown around here.  And 'possum.
And ladies with the Kentucky slur to their tongues&mdash;the
soft slur that leaves mighty few bachelors in those parts!
Better come along with us, old man.  What say?"
</p>

<p>
Macgowan shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"Thanks, but I can't.  Deming isn't doing anything?"
</p>

<p>
"No, he's definitely out of business.  By the way, we had
a caller at the house the other evening&mdash;that chap from
Evansville who's a relative of yours.  Ried Williams."
</p>

<p>
Macgowan glanced up in astonishment.
</p>

<p>
"Williams!  Is he in town?  Hope he doesn't look me up."
</p>

<p>
Armstrong laughed.  "Why?  Aren't you on good terms?"
</p>

<p>
"I suppose so." Macgowan shrugged lightly.  "I never
had much use for that chap; he's no good.  Look how he
cut up when we threw him out of Food Products!"
</p>

<p>
"While I never claimed to love him, I'd hate to insult
your relatives, Mac," and Armstrong laughed cheerily.
"His injured dignity has recovered; at least, he appeared
very amiable.  He's an old friend of Dorothy's; not a
dear friend, but he forms a link with her home town, you
know."
</p>

<p>
Macgowan stirred uneasily.  "He isn't locating here, is he?"
</p>

<p>
"No."  Armstrong leaned back.  "He's in the brokerage
business in Indianapolis, I gather.  You recall that
other man on the Food Products board, the one who looked
like a dissipated Adonis, and who aspired to Dorothy?
Pete Slosson?"
</p>

<p>
"Yep," grunted Macgowan.  His eyes, under veiling
lids, were very bright and keen.
</p>

<p>
"The two are in partnership and doing well, according to
Williams.  I always thought they both hated me like sin
for dumping them out of Food Products, but they've gotten
over it.  Williams showed up pretty well, though I'd not
trust him very far."
</p>

<p>
"Hope he leaves me alone in my glory," said Macgowan.
Then his face cleared.  "Say, one reason I dropped in was
about Findlater.  I think our merry little president is
going to spring a motion at next week's meeting for
salaried directors."
</p>

<p>
Armstrong's face tightened ominously.
</p>

<p>
"So he wants a cut of the melon?"
</p>

<p>
"Probably.  He has some of the others with him, and
figures that by springing a good argument he can get away
with it.  Judge Holcomb is dead against him, of course."
</p>

<p>
"Naturally; Holcomb's square.  What's your advice?"
</p>

<p>
Macgowan's gaze searched Armstrong with a steady and
appraising scrutiny.
</p>

<p>
"If it was my affair, Reese, I'd throw 'em out.  Bounce
them hard, get rid of them for good!  They're under
contract to serve for three years, without salary, in return
for stock allotted them; we're where we can do without
'em, and we owe them no debt of gratitude for getting
Consolidated under way.  A bunch of real live men on the
board would help us tremendously just now.  I say, if they
start any fuss, bounce them and begin over!"
</p>

<p>
Armstrong settled back in his chair, and shook his head
slightly.
</p>

<p>
"Well, why not?" demanded Macgowan.
</p>

<p>
"For the very reasons you name."  Armstrong stared
out the window and puffed silently.  This immobility
irritated Macgowan.
</p>

<p>
"What reasons?" he exclaimed harshly.
</p>

<p>
"I do owe them a certain gratitude for backing me.
They did it selfishly, but they did it.  And I'm too darned
human to forget that they did it."
</p>

<p>
"Too darned inhuman, you mean," interjected
Macgowan cynically.
</p>

<p>
Armstrong shrugged.  "I'm not an automatic machine,
and don't want the reputation of being one.  It's because
I'm human, Mac, that we've got nearly sixteen thousand
investors on our books, letting us handle their money.
Next year, twenty thousand.  I don't believe in using a
man for what you can get out of him, then kicking him
off the pedestal.  Findlater may be a fool and a crook, but
he helped us.  I don't care to be known as a business
machine; can't afford it.  The business of to-day and
to-morrow isn't being run that way."
</p>

<p>
"Chivalric balderdash!" Macgowan growled and
mouthed his cigar.  "Ever hear of Don Quixote?"
</p>

<p>
Armstrong, eyeing his friend, burst suddenly into a
laugh.
</p>

<p>
"What's got into you, Mac?  Are you talking what you
believe, or what you think is for my good?"
</p>

<p>
"For your own good, Reese!  Damn it, I know this game
better than you!"  Macgowan's burst of words came with
the fury of repressed energy.  Now appeared the hitherto
unguessed side of the man, the angry, passionate arrogance
of his mind which was usually so well covered from sight.
"Those fellows would kick you out this minute if they
could&mdash;you and me both!  That shyster Findlater would
knife you in the back if he had a chance.  The very thought
of our earnings, of our funds, makes 'em sweat to get their
paws on the money!  You fool, you're in business!  Why
don't you realize it?"
</p>

<p>
Armstrong surveyed him with cheerful good humor,
refusing to take this outburst seriously.
</p>

<p>
"Regular line of Old Testament bunk, Mac!  And you
don't mean a word of it.  As you know very well, we're
in business with a New Testament; a covenant of success to
all, not merely to those who have the quickest gun."
</p>

<p>
Macgowan uttered a savage oath.
</p>

<p>
"You fool, I mean it, every word of it!  Throw
Findlater out or you'll be thrown out!"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing doing."  Armstrong shrugged, but eyed his
friend curiously.  "You handle him with the voting trust,
and avoid trouble.  Be a diplomat."
</p>

<p>
"Diplomat, hell!"  Macgowan leaped up, faced Armstrong
with a bitter snarl.  "Wake up!  Are you a dursed
weak-kneed idealist, blind to everything but your ideals?
Can't you see that at times you have to be something else?
Are you one of these temperamental cusses, strong one
minute and up in the clouds the next?  Cut out this drivel!
I tell you, Findlater is a danger spot!  Want to wake up
and find you and your sentiment landed in the gutter, do
you?"
</p>

<p>
Armstrong was stung.  He leaned forward, suddenly
tense, concentrated.
</p>

<p>
"Mac, are you trying to tempt me&mdash;trying to see if you
can shake me?  Don't try it.  You know I brought a new
creed into this investment game, and I'm here to play the
game square and fair.  Once I falter in that creed, once I
begin to cheat at the game&mdash;good night!  Now, quit calling
me a fool.  Look at it through the eyes of our investors.
If they see me kick out Findlater, they'll think that it looks
queer; you can't blame them!  I'd think so too.  It isn't
time yet for fireworks.  Wait until the annual meeting
next April.  Then we'll start the slate with a new crowd
and go in for big things&mdash;honest things with honest men."
</p>

<p>
Macgowan drew a quick breath.
</p>

<p>
"Reese, you have a brain somewhere on the premises.  I
concede it.  You're right, as usual.  Say, do you sit up
nights thinking of those investors?"
</p>

<p>
"Nope; daytimes only."  Armstrong was too deeply
stirred up to call a halt now.  He went on with a growing
earnestness and conviction.  "It's those investors who
have put Consolidated on its feet.  Not a bunch of spoilers
sitting around a directors' table, but those little investors.
Their confidence in me is a terrible thing, Mac; it frightens
me sometimes, it humbles me&mdash;why, Mac, it's their very
faith which puts me over, makes me make good!  This
mass psychology is nothing new, even in business.  We
started out to get that very thing behind us.  Now that
we've got it, sometimes it frightens me by its very force.
They talk about prayer and its effect&mdash;here's the same
thing, man!  When every investor in our lists is behind
me, when I'm the apex of a triangle with every atom of
force at my back, shoving me forward&mdash;do you think I can
fail?  Do you think anybody can rise up and whip me?
Not much!"
</p>

<p>
Macgowan sat in spellbound silence.  As he listened, a
singular awe and wonder crept into his face.  His eyes,
fascinated by Armstrong's swordlike gaze, began to waver;
an indefinite something showed there that might have
gripped Armstrong's attention, had he only seen it.  One
never sees such expressions, however, when they are foreign
to all that one is expecting to see.  Armstrong went on
rapidly, fired by his thought.
</p>

<p>
"That's what put Napoleon over&mdash;the knowledge that
every man in his army knew he would win; and, damn it,
he had to win!  Same with me, Mac.  You've made
Consolidated airtight, you've left me nothing to fear at
my back.  I can look squarely ahead and can meet anything
that comes.  With the faith and will-power of sixteen
thousand people at my back, what can beat me?  Nothing!
Nothing!  It's not self-confidence; it's confidence in the
power behind me, the power instilled into me!  Can't you
see that?"
</p>

<p>
Macgowan shifted his pose restlessly, before he came to
his feet, jabbing at Armstrong with his cigar, an oath of
admiration breaking on his lips.  He seemed swept away,
enthused beyond words, almost.
</p>

<p>
"Reese&mdash;oh, what's the use!"  He made a despairing
gesture.  "I'm proud to have a share in your vision,
proud to take orders from you.  Now, if Findlater starts
any fuss, you want him soft-pedaled.  Is that it?"
</p>

<p>
Armstrong relaxed, nodding, a bit self-conscious and
ashamed of his outburst.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  That's what you and Jimmy Wren have the
voting trust for!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  That reminds me&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Macgowan was picking up his coat and hat and stick.
He turned and came back to the desk, looking thoughtfully
down at Armstrong.
</p>

<p>
"I nearly forgot something.  About Wren."
</p>

<p>
Armstrong glanced up inquiringly.  Wren was not only
his right-hand man in the Armstrong Company, but was
secretary of Consolidated.  Although not so young in
years, Jimmy Wren possessed that eternal buoyancy, that
youthfulness of spirit, which older men envy.  His
imagination and impulsiveness added to his ability; he was all
or nothing.
</p>

<p>
"What about Jimmy?"
</p>

<p>
Macgowan looked serious.  "It may not be true.  I just
heard that, before Wren came to us, he was mixed up in a
nasty affair back in Ohio.  A small country bank, which
went bust.  Wren was cashier, and squeaked through, but
it was close.  Know anything about it?"
</p>

<p>
Armstrong squared himself in his chair.
</p>

<p>
"I know all about it."
</p>

<p>
"Good.  Then I've no more to say."
</p>

<p>
"Hold on!"  Armstrong's voice cracked out suddenly.
"You <i>have</i> something more to say, Mac.  I want to know
where this report came from."
</p>

<p>
Macgowan met those clear, angry eyes with unruffled
mien.
</p>

<p>
"From a federal man.  You know, I've a good many
friends in Washington.  One of them, in the revenue
service, was going over some income tax returns with me.
We got to talking about the company, and he mentioned
this about young Wren.  He knew few details."
</p>

<p>
"Then it was simply a friendly tip?"
</p>

<p>
"Sure."
</p>

<p>
Armstrong nodded.  His face cleared.
</p>

<p>
"Then forget it, Mac.  I'll go to the mat for Jimmy any
day!  That bank affair was no fault of his; the bonding
company exonerated him absolutely.  He came to me with
the whole business when I sent for him to join me.  I've
known him for years, and he's true blue.  By the way, Mac,
who's the lady he's been shining up to lately?  He keeps
unusually mum on the subject, I notice.  Weren't you in
on the party the other day at the Biltmore?"
</p>

<p>
Macgowan chuckled, and shrugged.
</p>

<p>
"I saw your eagle eye fastened on us from across the
room.  Good lord, don't ask me!  I just wandered in on
that party, and we lunched together.  Don't even recall
her name&mdash;from the South, I think.  She wasn't a bad sort
at all.  Well, I'll drift along.  See you later!"
</p>

<p>
Macgowan departed.
</p>

<p>
Armstrong felt very glad of this conversation; he felt
that it had cleared the air for him, had left him more
cheerfully disposed, in better control of himself.  When Findlater
entered his office ten minutes later, Armstrong glanced
up and nodded amiably.
</p>

<p>
"Good morning, Mr. President!  What's on your mind?"
</p>

<p>
"This report."  Findlater tapped the paper in his hand.
"Have you examined it?"
</p>

<p>
Armstrong smiled.  "My dear chap, I wrote it!"
</p>

<p>
Findlater, a New Yorker by birth, tried very hard to live
up to the fact that his immediate ancestors had come from
Boston.  His grooming was perfect.  A clipped red mustache,
firm lips set in eternal repression, a coldly challenging
gaze from a pink and chubby face&mdash;all went to make
up an air of aggressive importance.  Findlater studiously
cultivated an aloof manner.  One gathered that his fingers
touched only supremely great things.
</p>

<p>
Armstrong, who detested this affectation, perhaps made
the mistake of under-estimating the qualities which lay
beneath it.
</p>

<p>
"What's wrong with the report?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid it will give our investors a wrong
impression," said Findlater, with his best judicial air.  "We
have poured a good deal of money into this Food Products
concern.  Instead of spreading our money among various
enterprises, we are plunging on one or two things.  The
heavy surplus and corporate funds should be retained more
carefully against a rainy day, and more carefully spread
out."
</p>

<p>
Armstrong nodded.  "We make money work for us," he
said in perfect good humor.  "We can't afford to have it
lie idle, you know.  As for Food Products, everything that
we put in will come back with heavy interest; it'll be our
finest property in course of time.  You speak of spreading
out our money.  Have you some enterprise in mind?"
</p>

<p>
"Well," Findlater showed a bit of hesitation, "a very
promising affair has been brought to my attention&mdash;a new
process for refining and producing turpentine&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"A going enterprise?" asked Armstrong quietly.
</p>

<p>
"Not exactly.  A most promising invention&mdash;a friend of
mine&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Armstrong leaned back and regarded the other man
amusedly.
</p>

<p>
"Too clumsy, Findlater; I'm really surprised!  Of
course, you'd like us to build a plant and experiment with
your friend's invention.  Perhaps we might buy the
invention outright, eh?  I'm afraid it won't do, Findlater.
We're not a get-rich-quick concern at all.  If you want to
do any juggling with the funds of Consolidated, you'll do it
when I'm no longer connected with the company.  That's all."
</p>

<p>
Findlater's pink-and-white face grew very red; without
a word, he turned and left the room.  Armstrong smiled to
himself and resumed his interrupted work.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VI
</h3>

<p>
Dorothy went to the city on a Tuesday, in order
to inspect some furniture that was being done over
to suit her scheme of things, and also in order to
do some early Christmas shopping.  Armstrong knew
nothing of her coming.  When she dropped into the office
about noon, she discovered that he was downtown on
business and would not be back until later in the afternoon.
</p>

<p>
Jimmy Wren passed through the reception room, turned
to her with a delighted greeting, and Dorothy at once
commandeered him.
</p>

<p>
"Reese is somewhere downtown, and I want to take
advantage of his absence to find him a Christmas present.
You're a sensible young man, Jimmy, so I'll call on you
for advice&mdash;if it'll not interfere.  Can you get away to go
shopping with me?"
</p>

<p>
"You bet!" exclaimed Wren heartily.  "You've not
lunched?  Good.  We'll get a bite to eat and then go
sleuthing for something that'll make the old boy's eyes
stand out when he lamps it Christmas morning.  Eh?
Fine!  I'll be out in a second."
</p>

<p>
"If you're sure it won't interfere&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Not a bit of it!  I wouldn't miss the chance for
worlds&mdash;chance to spend your money, I mean&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
With a grin, Jimmy Wren rushed off for his hat and coat,
and they went out together.
</p>

<p>
Dorothy liked Wren, liked his unspoiled enthusiasm;
beneath his impulsive warmth there was a great fund of
shrewdness and ability.  None the less, he possessed a
certain open ingenuousness of character, a wide-eyed
confidence in people, as though his boyish illusions had
never been shattered.  In the office, Wren's whiplash
keenness was all to the fore.  Out of the office, he was
himself&mdash;clean and frank and unafraid.  Behind his
black-rimmed spectacles, his gray eyes danced with energy
and high humor.  One liked Jimmy Wren at sight, and
Jimmy either liked or disliked the other person with swift
impulse.
</p>

<p>
They walked to the Biltmore, and were presently seated
at a window-table <i>à deux</i>.
</p>

<p>
The order given, Jimmy lighted a cigarette.  Dorothy
observed that he was glancing about as though in search of
some one, and suddenly his eyes lighted up eagerly.  There
was no mistaking this radiant delight, and she was not
surprised when he excused himself for a moment to speak
to some one, and rose.
</p>

<p>
Smiling, Dorothy glanced after him.
</p>

<p>
"Jimmy ought to marry and settle down," she reflected,
with all the shameless match-making instinct of the happily
married bride.  "I wonder who she could be?  He's never
breathed a word to Reese, I'm sure&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Dorothy's instinct was not at fault.  As her glance
followed the wide-shouldered figure of Jimmy Wren, it
rested upon a table near the entrance.  At this table sat
two men and a woman, very handsomely gowned and
furred in white, to whom Wren was speaking.
</p>

<p>
Both the men were unknown to Dorothy.  The face of
the woman was hidden until Wren turned to leave; then
she had one swift, clear glimpse of the profile&mdash;a striking
and unforgettable profile.  The eyes of Dorothy widened
suddenly, widened with astounded incredulity; and their
steely blue was altered to a stormy violet.
</p>

<p>
Beaming all over, Jimmy Wren returned and slid into
his chair.
</p>

<p>
"That friend of mine&mdash;by George, I wish you knew her!"
he exclaimed enthusiastically.  "A wonderful woman,
Mrs. Armstrong, and from the South, too.  Mrs. Bird Fowler of
Paducah.  Talk about your Kentucky belles!  Perhaps
you know her, though?  Isn't Paducah somewhere near
Evansville?"
</p>

<p>
Dorothy, smiling, shook her head.
</p>

<p>
"There are a number of Fowlers; the river-packets used
to be named after them, you know, but I don't think I know
your friend.  Of course, one can't keep track of every
member of a famous family."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose not," assented Wren.
</p>

<p>
"Is she a widow?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Had a frightful time with her husband, I
understand.  Poor girl!"
</p>

<p>
At this, Dorothy bit her lip.
</p>

<p>
"I caught a glimpse of the lady's face," she said sweetly.
"She looked like some one I used to know in Evansville."
</p>

<p>
A peculiar nuance of her voice held Wren's attention.
</p>

<p>
"Eh?  She's the same one?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, of course not&mdash;merely a fancied resemblance,"
responded Dorothy with assurance.  "You see, Jimmy, this
Evansville girl was very unfortunate; Viola Bland was her
name.  She was a stunning beauty, and her mother forced
her to marry for money, and&mdash;well, poor Viola just didn't
care, I suppose!"
</p>

<p>
"How do you mean?" queried Wren, staring at her.
Dorothy made an indescribable gesture.
</p>

<p>
"A terrible scandal, my dear Jimmy!  She became quite
the talk of the town.  Finally she decamped with another
lady's husband and there were divorces and everything.
I always felt very sorry for poor Viola."
</p>

<p>
Jimmy Wren blushed faintly, but looked relieved.
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Fowler might not be flattered by the resemblance,
then," he said drily.  "She's awfully keen on the
proprieties and all that sort of thing."
</p>

<p>
"How did you come to meet her, if I may ask?"
</p>

<p>
"Came in here one day with Macgowan to luncheon, and
met her; she was lunching with a chap he knew&mdash;that's the
man over there now, with her; his back to us.  Harry
Lorenz.  He's a broker or something that doesn't take
work."
</p>

<p>
Dorothy nodded.  She had heard Armstrong speak of
Macgowan's intimacy with Harry Lorenz, and now she
frowned slightly.
</p>

<p>
"Is she a friend of Lawrence Macgowan?" she enquired.
</p>

<p>
"I don't think he knows her, except casually," said
Wren.  Then he kindled.  "I've been up to her place
several times; she has a wonderful little apartment uptown,
and gives small musical affairs there.  She has the voice
of an angel!  She's thinking of giving some big recitals
later in the season.  Not for the money&mdash;she doesn't need
that: but for some charity she's interested in.  She knows
all the big musical people.  They say Caruso advised her
to go into opera, but she won't do that."
</p>

<p>
Luncheon arrived.  Wren was too absorbed in his subject
to be observant, or he might have noticed a singular
change in Dorothy's manner.  Her careless gayety had
quite departed.  In its stead, there appeared an active and
keen interest, a tense eagerness.  She seemed suddenly all
on the alert, as though she had glimpsed some antagonist
and were seeking an opening for her weapons.
</p>

<p>
And so, in fact, she had.
</p>

<p>
"Do you know Macgowan well, Jimmy?" she asked
presently.
</p>

<p>
"Not very much, outside the office.  A wonderful chap,
isn't he?  Been splendid to me, too; put me up at clubs
and that sort of thing.  He's pretty deep, too."
</p>

<p>
"Just what do you mean by that?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, it's hard to say."  Wren hesitated.  "He seems
to be all on the surface, but he's not.  He knows more
than you'd think.  There are good solid depths to him."
</p>

<p>
Dorothy abruptly changed the subject.
</p>

<p>
When they rose to leave, the party of three near the
entrance were still in place.  Jimmy Wren was close
behind Dorothy.  As they passed the table, the woman who
called herself Mrs. Bird Fowler glanced up, met the gaze
of Dorothy&mdash;and into her eyes leaped sudden, startled
recognition.  Dorothy halted, with every appearance of
delighted surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Dorothy Deming!" exclaimed the other woman, almost
mechanically.
</p>

<p>
"Why, Viola Bland!" broke from Dorothy at the same
instant.  "Who on earth would have thought of meeting
you here&mdash;and how well you're looking!  I'm so glad to
see you!"
</p>

<p>
"Won't you sit down&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, my dear, I'm simply rushed to death!  We're
very late now&mdash;I daren't stop even for a minute.  Call
me up some day, won't you?  Mrs. Reese Armstrong, you
know&mdash;good-by!"
</p>

<p>
Dorothy swept on.  At the entrance she turned to Jimmy
Wren.  His face was indescribable.
</p>

<p>
"Leave the wraps, Jimmy.  Come and sit down.  I
want to talk with you."
</p>

<p>
He obeyed meekly, a man inwardly stricken.  They
turned into the lounge and Dorothy took possession of a
sofa.
</p>

<p>
"Light a cigarette, Jimmy.  You need it."
</p>

<p>
"I do," he assented bitterly, and drew a deep breath.
"By gad!  Isn't there a mistake?"
</p>

<p>
His very tone showed that he knew there was no mistake.
Dorothy leaned back and in silence studied him for a
moment or two.  She was not enjoying her triumph; when
Wren looked up and met her eyes, he realized this.
</p>

<p>
"Jimmy, it hurt," she said simply.  "Can't you see
why I did it?  Because I like you.  Because Reese likes
you.  I suppose she always wears white?  Some people do;
it seems to be a matter of necessity."
</p>

<p>
Wren started at that.
</p>

<p>
"It's not true!" he exclaimed, but his impulsive speech
died in silence.
</p>

<p>
Dorothy shrugged.  "My dear Jimmy, just stop and
think what was said.  I don't believe any argument is
necessary."
</p>

<p>
Wren was in torment.  He saw, clearly enough, the
absolute finality of the whole thing.  When "Mrs. Bird
Fowler" gave vent to her recognition of Dorothy, she had
been lost beyond any appeal of error.  Now Dorothy
continued coolly.
</p>

<p>
"If you have any doubts in the matter, take a trip to
Evansville and ask questions.  You might as well get it
all in one blunt and brutal shock, and have it over.  I'm
sorry for your sake, Jimmy, but I'd be much sorrier
if&mdash;if I had just let things go on."
</p>

<p>
Wren nodded miserably.
</p>

<p>
"People always seem to make a fool out of me," he said
boyishly.  "There was a bank back in Ohio&mdash;I was the
cashier.  Another fellow pulled some dirty work, and
I came mighty close to going over the road.  Only plain
fool luck saved me!  And now&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Reese doesn't think you're a fool, and neither do I,"
said Dorothy.  "Forget all that silly talk, Jimmy!  Don't
blame yourself.  You've made me terribly afraid, this
morning&mdash;something you said&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Her words fell off.  Wren stared at her, puzzled.
</p>

<p>
"I've made you afraid?  Of what?"
</p>

<p>
Dorothy smiled, but with an effort.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know; I can't say, Jimmy.  Did you ever read
<i>Othello</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"Shakespeare?  Oh, sure.  What's that got to do with it?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing, perhaps.  But there are some men like Iago,
either in big or small ways.  Do you believe that a man
could have a corrosive touch&mdash;a touch that corrodes every
one with whom he comes in contact, morally or in other
ways?  A man who makes use of everybody and twists
them to his own desires, and leaves them all broken or
rotted out behind him?"
</p>

<p>
Jimmy Wren frowned over this.
</p>

<p>
"Why, I suppose so," he answered vaguely.  "I've read
about women like that, in stories, but I never ran up
against any men&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Dorothy rose, with a silvery laugh.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it was a passing fancy; never mind.  Now look
here, Jimmy Wren!  You brace up and forget this.  It's
our secret, understand?  If any more handsome widows
from Kentucky show up on the horizon, let me know and
I'll throw a party at a hotel up in the forties where there
are loads of Kentucky people&mdash;and you'll see fireworks!
Now, forget it."
</p>

<p>
"All right, I promise."  Jimmy Wren forced a rueful
grin.  "Now, about the Christmas present for Reese&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Go get the wraps, please.  I'll wait here."
</p>

<p>
Dorothy smiled to herself after Wren's departing figure,
and this time her smile was not forced.
</p>

<p>
"Poor Jimmy!" she murmured.  "He's not so badly
hurt as he thinks he is; he'll forget all about it in a week.
Macgowan and this Harry Lorenz and Viola Bland&mdash;hm!
I don't like it.  Maybe I'm all wrong, of course, but I
don't like it.  Now, why would Macgowan want to get
poor Jimmy Wren in that crowd, I wonder?  If only I
could reason it out!  I'd give a good deal to learn just
how well Lawrence Macgowan knows Viola, and how long
he's known her!  I hope she will ring me up some day."
</p>

<p>
She never did.  But she rang up Jimmy Wren about a
little musicale; and Jimmy, having his full share of
unspoiled human nature, did not refuse the invitation.  His
boyishness rather resented Dorothy's severe judgment of
the other woman; after all, he considered, the world judges
harshly, without knowing everything!
</p>

<p>
And he was gradually confirmed in this opinion.  He
did not consider it necessary to bring up the matter again
with Dorothy, however.

<h3>
CHAPTER VII
</h3>

<p>
Armstrong had arranged to start for Evansville
four days before Christmas.  He and Dorothy
were to leave New York by a night train.
</p>

<p>
That same morning, he learned something that staggered
him, frightened him, yet filled him with a great veneration
and joy.  When he looked across the breakfast-table at
Dorothy, when he met the consuming happiness of her eyes,
she had suddenly become like another person to
him&mdash;another and more wondrous woman.
</p>

<p>
"You're not afraid?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Afraid?  Good heavens, no!  Reese, I'm the happiest
woman on earth!  Aren't you glad?  You don't look it.
You look frightened."
</p>

<p>
"I am, for your sake," he said, and smiled.  "Oh, I'm
happy too!  I want to tell every one&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Don't you dare!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I shan't.  But I should think you'd dread the long
months ahead, and all the pain and suffering&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Dorothy silenced him with a peremptory gesture as the
maid appeared.  Then, when they were alone again, she
laughed gayly at him.
</p>

<p>
"You funny man!  Everything's going to be wonderful&mdash;even
the suffering.  It's all we need to make us really
happy, to give us a real home!  Now, don't say another
word about it, or that maid will suspect.  You pay
attention to breakfast or you'll miss your train."
</p>

<p>
"Be sure to put my bag in the car when John drives you
in," said Armstrong, after the meal was over and he was
leaving.  "Have him bring you to the office about six, and
we'll get dinner somewhere before the train leaves.
Good-by, lady!"
</p>

<p>
In their parting kiss at the door there was a new
tenderness, born of the knowledge lying in their hearts.
</p>

<p>
All the way to town that knowledge kept pounding at
Armstrong's brain.  His first awe and fear passed into a
burning joy.  Little by little, he began to visualize how
from this minute everything was changed, how his plans
and Dorothy's must be made to conform with greater
events, how their whole scheme of things must be brought
to defer to the arrival of this welcome guest.
</p>

<p>
Armstrong was quite determined on one thing.  He must
expend every energy to insure Dorothy's peace of mind
during the months to come.  Physicians would take care
of the body; he must make it his business to see that, when
this baby arrived, it should have an heritage of untroubled
nerves in the mother, and a peaceful spirit.
</p>

<p>
"And I'll do it," he told himself.  "Thank God, she's
got plenty of plain common sense, and doesn't go into
hysterics every time a pin falls!  She shan't have one
troubled thought in the whole time, if I can manage it."
</p>

<p>
Upon this resolve, he reached his office.
</p>

<p>
Almost before he had gone through his mail, a memorandum
was handed in from the president's office.  To his
irritated astonishment, Armstrong found this to be a
proposal to finance the National Reduction Company&mdash;the
same turpentine scheme which Findlater had previously
broached in vain.
</p>

<p>
Armstrong reached for his desk telephone.  "I'd like to
see Mr. Findlater at once."
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Macgowan is with him just now, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Ask them both to come over to my office."
</p>

<p>
A moment later the door opened and Armstrong nodded
to the two men.
</p>

<p>
"Good morning.  I'd like to see you, Findlater, about
this National Reduction affair.  Sit down and make
yourself comfortable."
</p>

<p>
Findlater, who appeared rather nervous, drew up a chair.
Macgowan lighted a cigar and stretched himself on the
lounge across the office.  He seemed to anticipate what was
coming and appeared to be enjoying himself hugely.
</p>

<p>
"That is merely a tentative outline, reduced to writing,"
began Findlater, indicating the paper in Armstrong's hand.
"I felt that perhaps in speaking of it I had not presented
the matter fairly to you."
</p>

<p>
Armstrong regarded him for a moment, then spoke
crisply.
</p>

<p>
"We may just as well have an understanding here and
now, Findlater.  I see the proposal is that Consolidated
shall spend over a hundred thousand to finance the ideas of
an inventor.  Our stockholders get nothing for their money
except the chance of experimenting in turpentine reduction.
That's the idea, isn't it?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Findlater aggressively.  "Add to that, the
fact that the inventor is personally known to and vouched
for by me.  His invention is a proven success.  Once a
plant is built, it will make big money from the start."
</p>

<p>
Armstrong glanced at the paper again.
</p>

<p>
"I note here that the whole thing seems cut and dried.
For example, this item about stock.  Fifteen hundred
shares of the proposed Reduction stock are to be divided
among certain directors of Consolidated Securities, as a
free personal bonus.  A bonus for what, may I ask?"
</p>

<p>
Findlater took courage from this quiet manner.
</p>

<p>
"For service," he returned.  "Five hundred shares to
you, since the Armstrong Company will naturally peddle
the stock.  Five hundred to me, for my personal interest in
the affair.  The other five hundred will be divided among
Macgowan, for legal services, and our other directors."
</p>

<p>
Armstrong shot a look at his friend.
</p>

<p>
"You in on this too?"
</p>

<p>
Macgowan waved his cigar.  "Henry C. Findlater is
making the proposal; I'm not!  It's all news to me."
</p>

<p>
Armstrong turned his attention to Findlater.
</p>

<p>
"Let's see.  We finance this plant out of Consolidated
funds, which belong to the stockholders of Consolidated.
My selling organization takes this stock out and sells it to
our investors.  A good many of them buy it on our
unsupported word, because they have faith in us.  They pay
so much down, so much per month, all out of their savings.
Correct?"
</p>

<p>
Findlater, a bit puzzled, nodded assent.
</p>

<p>
"In other words," went an Armstrong, "you propose
that we take an extremely long chance with a hundred
thousand of trust funds, and employ the confidence of our
investors to draw their money into the scheme also.  For
doing so, we split fifteen hundred shares of the stock free.
This, Findlater, is nothing short of bribery.  The whole
scheme is a misuse of confidence; or, if you prefer the
word&mdash;theft."
</p>

<p>
Findlater came to his feet, his face purple.
</p>

<p>
"I won't stand such words, Armstrong!" he cried
passionately.  "I won't stand&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Then get out," snapped Armstrong, who was white
with anger.
</p>

<p>
Findlater stood motionless, silent, under that unwavering
gaze.  His flushed features betrayed a tremendous effort to
hold his anger in check.
</p>

<p>
"You'll be damned sorry for this!" he said slowly.
</p>

<p>
"Is that a threat?" asked Macgowan, sitting up.
</p>

<p>
Findlater whirled on him.  "Shut up!  I've had enough
of your hectoring and bullying; you change your ways or
I'll make trouble!"
</p>

<p>
"Look here, Findlater," cut in Armstrong's quiet voice,
and the other turned again.  "You're under a three year
contract to serve this company as president, in consideration
of a thousand shares of Consolidated common.  Let's
have it straight, now.  You're threatening me?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I'm not," said Findlater, trembling with rage.
"I'm saying that you'll be damned sorry if you turn down
this proposition!  Some one else will take it up and make
big money."
</p>

<p>
"Oh," said Armstrong, and relaxed.  "Let them have it
and welcome.  That's final.  Now, may I ask how you'll
make trouble for Macgowan?"
</p>

<p>
Findlater mastered himself, and made response in a
calmer tone.
</p>

<p>
"I propose to be treated as a gentleman, that's all.  Mac
comes in and orders me about like a dog; and I want it to
stop!  As for making trouble, that meant nothing.  I&mdash;I
think my nerves are jangled this morning.  Since you
won't consider the matter at all, that ends it."
</p>

<p>
"Conceded," said Armstrong, and held out the paper.
</p>

<p>
Findlater took it, nodded, and left the room.
</p>

<p>
Armstrong looked at Macgowan and smiled thinly.
"You seem to be on the gentleman's nerves, Mac.  An
obstinate devil, isn't he?"
</p>

<p>
"He climbed off his perch mighty quick," returned
Macgowan.  "I don't know when I've seen a better job of
dismounting from a high horse!  Well, I must run along.
See you later.  You're leaving to-night?"
</p>

<p>
Armstrong assented, and Macgowan left.
</p>

<p>
There would be no further trouble with the nominal
president, at least for a while, felt Armstrong.  Blocked in
his efforts to vote directors' salaries, he had conceived this
other scheme of looting; he would now, doubtless, turn his
attention to matters outside Consolidated.
</p>

<p>
So Armstrong forgot the matter of the National
Reduction Company.
</p>

<p>
He picked up Jimmy Wren for luncheon, and found himself
immensely benefited by that young man's eager
exuberance.  The Armstrong Company was to all intents
under the hand of Wren, who was given a free rein like
other of Armstrong's chief men; this vastly aided their self
confidence and sense of responsibility, and any interference
by Armstrong was made indirectly.  It was good for the
company to have men like Jimmy Wren feel that their
executive ability was recognized and given scope to work.
</p>

<p>
Armstrong tried to induce Wren to join the Christmas
festivities at Evansville, but met with an embarrassed
refusal which vaguely puzzled him.  He knew nothing of
Dorothy's encounter with "Mrs. Bird Fowler."  He did
know, however, that of late Jimmy Wren had been not
quite himself, and appeared to be in need of a vacation.
Upon returning from luncheon, Armstrong took Wren to
his own office.
</p>

<p>
"Come in and go over this Food Products campaign,"
he said.  "There are one or two points I'd like to
discuss&mdash;hello!"
</p>

<p>
He threw open the office door to disclose the figure of
Macgowan, striding up and down the room.  Macgowan
swung around hastily and showed a disturbed countenance.
</p>

<p>
"Ha, Reese!  I had to see you at once&mdash;something
infernally bad!  Come along, Jimmy; you're in on it too."
</p>

<p>
The manner of Macgowan was startling.  Armstrong
threw off hat and coat, and Macgowan went on speaking
rapidly.
</p>

<p>
"It's a good thing this turned up before you left, Reese.
I don't know just what to make of it.  Either this is an
outrageous lie, or there's something queer going on."
</p>

<p>
Advancing to Armstrong's desk, he spread out a letter.
The other two men leaned over, reading it with incredulous
eyes.  It was addressed to Macgowan, was written from
Seattle, and was signed by one Elmer Lewis, junior partner
in a Seattle law firm.
</p>

<p>
"Lewis is an old friend of mine," said Macgowan.
"He's straight."
</p>

<p>
The letter set forth that the Armstrong Company salesmen
on the coast were using everything but violence in the
effort to unload Food Products, were sticking at no
misrepresentation.  It went on:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"I am writing this, Mac, so you may stave off trouble.  These
Armstrong salesmen are using your name freely, in connection
with obviously untrue statements.
</p>

<p>
"Since these stock sales appear to be managed from New
York by mail, the matter may become serious.  I understand
that complaints have already been made to Washington, and that
an investigation by the postal authorities may be under way."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Jimmy Wren straightened up with a grunt of disgust.
</p>

<p>
"This guy Lewis had better get investigated for mental
chaos!  Did you ever see anything to beat this?"
</p>

<p>
Armstrong looked up, frowning.
</p>

<p>
"Mac, what the devil can it mean?"
</p>

<p>
"How do I know?"  Macgowan shrugged.  "All I know
is right there.  If these men of yours are getting into
trouble and making use of my name&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"It's a lie from start to finish!" snapped Armstrong.
</p>

<p>
"There's something queer about this letter.  Jimmy, do
your coast reports show any such situation out there?"
</p>

<p>
"Not a thing," said Wren promptly.  "The entire
allotment of Food Products stock will be sold out before
the coast men quit work, the first of the year.  They are
furious because we're quitting the territory.  Looks like
all they do out there is to show the prospect where the
dotted line is.  This letter is bunk!"
</p>

<p>
"It's not that," returned Armstrong thoughtfully.
"It's written by a friend who wants to save Mac from
trouble.  It's possible that some disgruntled investor has
raised some kind of howl&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"In such case," interposed Wren with some heat, "can't
he turn in his stock and get his money back?  Haven't we
a standing agreement to protect every dissatisfied investor?
Is there the least excuse for anybody running to the postal
authorities?"
</p>

<p>
Armstrong shook his head.  "It's past me.  What about
it, Mac?"
</p>

<p>
Macgowan had entirely lost his nervous air.  He was
watching Armstrong closely.  Now he lighted a cigar,
flourished the match, and responded with some deliberation.
</p>

<p>
"As you say, it's possible that some one has sent in a
complaint; perhaps to a newspaper which has played the
matter up strong.  Maybe Lewis saw something in the
paper and wrote me without knowing all the circumstances.
Of course, the whole thing is absurd&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Your friend Lewis does not substantiate his
statements," said Armstrong.  "But if the authorities are
starting any investigation, we want to know it!  There's
no foundation for anything of the kind, but the fact that
we're under investigation will hurt us.  There's no
protection except by going direct to the source."
</p>

<p>
He sat down at the desk and took up the telephone.
</p>

<p>
"Get me the Dorns Detective Agency.  I want Robert
Dorns personally."
</p>

<p>
Macgowan swung around as though he had been shot.
</p>

<p>
"Wait!  Give me a word first!"
</p>

<p>
At this swift, imperative command, Armstrong's eyes
widened.  He had never heard Macgowan use such a tone.
He told the operator to hold up the call.
</p>

<p>
"What is it, Mac?"
</p>

<p>
"Just this.  If you call Dorns into the matter, he may
cause trouble&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"He's the biggest detective in the country, absolutely
responsible."
</p>

<p>
"Sure.  At the same time, the matter can be better
handled from the inside.  I'll run down to Washington
to-night.  You know, I have a good many friends there,
Federal men and others.  If any investigation is going on,
I can check it quicker than Dorns could."
</p>

<p>
"I don't want it checked!" said Armstrong angrily.  "I
want everything wide open!  And I want these reports run
down to the ground!"
</p>

<p>
"Leave that to me," returned Macgowan, with assurance.
"Wren can give me all his letters and instructions to
agents.  I'll guarantee to satisfy the postal men in an
hour's time.  Then I'll take up the letter itself with Lewis
and see what's back of it; I'll wire him at once, in fact.
You'll do better to keep these things in the family, Reese,
than to call in any outside help."
</p>

<p>
Armstrong considered this, and found it good.  That
any breath of suspicion should be cast on his methods,
angered him intensely; on the other hand, there was so
obviously some inexplicable mistake involved that it
behooved him to go slow.
</p>

<p>
His business was founded upon confidence.  The only
way in which Consolidated could be attacked, the only way
in which Armstrong himself could be attacked, was by
attacking the confidence of the thousands of investors.
That this letter from Seattle indicated any such attack,
never for an instant occurred to him.
</p>

<p>
"All right," he said at length.  "Take care of it in your
own way, Mac.  Advise me at Evansville just what's
behind this, or what's going on."
</p>

<p>
Macgowan assented briefly, and seized his things.  If he
were to catch the Washington flyer that night, he had much
to do.  When he had departed, Jimmy Wren frowned and
lighted a dead cigar.
</p>

<p>
"Mac was sweating.  All worked up; notice it?  Hope
he'll handle things right.  I'm off to wire the coast.  If
I get any answers before you leave, I'll let you know."
</p>

<p>
Armstrong found himself alone.
</p>

<p>
Gradually his indignation died away.  Nothing so stings
the soul of a man as injustice, and the entire content of
that Seattle letter was false to the core&mdash;falser even than
Armstrong dreamed at the moment.  It was not the threatened
trouble which hurt, not the warning sent Macgowan,
but the black falsity of the whole affair.
</p>

<p>
Armstrong laughed at the thought of heading off the
threatened inquiry.  Any probe into the methods of
Consolidated or of the Armstrong Company, would only result
in exoneration.  That the salesmen were misrepresenting
Food Products was ridiculously untrue.  Armstrong knew
his salesmen.
</p>

<p>
"Yet that letter worries me," thought Armstrong.  "I
wish now that I'd gone ahead and employed Dorns.  Why
the devil was Mac so worried over a Federal inquiry?
We've nothing to fear from that end.  Something queer
about it all; I don't savvy it."
</p>

<p>
At this moment he remembered the promise he had made
to Dorothy.
</p>

<p>
The thought disturbed him.  That request had not been
empty words.  When she asked for his promise, she meant
exactly what she said; perhaps, he reflected, that request of
hers had some unguessed reason behind it.
</p>

<p>
Armstrong frowned.  He realized that now he must
either break his promise to her, or keep it.  Some such
emergency as this, some such threat of trouble, was just
what she must have had in mind when she had extracted
the promise.  Business was no overwhelming mystery to
her.  Yet this letter from Seattle&mdash;nonsense!  There was
no trouble here.  The whole thing was absurd.  Nothing
could come of this; there was no basis.  And just now the
important thing was to keep Dorothy's peace of mind
secure and serene.
</p>

<p>
"I wouldn't bother her now if the whole organization
were collapsing&mdash;which it's not!" thought Armstrong.
</p>

<p>
At four-thirty Jimmy Wren appeared beaming, and
displayed a telegram from the Seattle sales manager,
branding the report as wholly false.  There was not a
single dissatisfied investor in the coast territory, so far as
was known.
</p>

<p>
"Want to stop Macgowan?" asked Wren.  "I can catch
him at his office."
</p>

<p>
"Let him go," said Armstrong.  "If there's anything
at all in this, he'd better ferret it out and kill it.  You
wire the Seattle manager to investigate Elmer Lewis.
That letter looks queer to me.  Let me know at Evansville
what you learn."
</p>

<p>
When Armstrong met Dorothy for dinner, he had dismissed
the affair from his mind, and said nothing to her
about it.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII
</h3>

<p>
Christmas in Evansville to some degree reflected
the warm holiday celebration of the South, which is
not individual but general in scope, not personal
but social; making up in its own way for the lack of snow
and more vigorous Northern traditions.
</p>

<p>
Dwindling stores of sherry and bourbon were opened
with unreserved bounty, while "white mule" from across
the river had its own share in affairs.  Old recipes
provided for egg-nogg, smooth as silk and strong as
black-label Bacardi, or for fruit-cake whose fragrance was an
almost forgotten memory, to be passed about by more
skilled or fortunate housewives to others.  In such matters
Dorothy was busy almost from the moment of her arrival,
for these delicately adjusted recipes were not left to the
hands of servants.
</p>

<p>
Armstrong found himself engulfed in a whirl of hospitality
whose spontaneous gayety and open-hearted sincerity
took him back to college days, and banished worry.
Having heard nothing from Macgowan, he knew that all
was well behind him, and forgot his troubles.
</p>

<p>
Both Williams and Slosson came down over the holidays
from Indianapolis, where their brokerage business was
thriving, and called at the Deming residence.  Their
greeting to Armstrong was heartily cordial, and all the former
ill feeling seemed past and forgotten.  For this, Dorothy
was grateful.  Not that she particularly cared for either
man, but she did want Armstrong's memories of Evansville
to be untroubled by contact with any who were not
warm-hearted friends.  She need not have worried; Armstrong
gave not a second thought to either Slosson or Ried
Williams.
</p>

<p>
The winter of Dorothy's discontent and unrest, however,
was ushered in with the dinner dance at the Country
Club.  It was Friday night, with Christmas only a day
away.
</p>

<p>
The club was in gala dress, with fireplaces blazing
merrily, a "string band" of darkies whose music made the
toes tingle, a huge tree, and a repast to make Epicurus
envious.  In the course of the evening, Dorothy was
captured by one Joel Giddings, an antique beau who was
very deaf, and whose dancing was execrable.  Being quite
accustomed to requests that he "sit out" a dance, Giddings
yielded amiably to Dorothy's wishes and guided her to a
very secluded nook behind the Christmas tree.
</p>

<p>
They sat there, almost hidden from sight, while Giddings
rattled on about nothing.  Then, as Dorothy listened, she
heard another voice&mdash;a voice which came from close by,
although the glittering tree hid the speaker from sight.
</p>

<p>
"Armstrong doesn't worry much about showing up
here," it said.  "I suppose he figures that nobody knows
just how he got control of Food Products, anyhow!  What
I can't understand is why Deming endures him, after the
way he chucked Deming out of his own business!"
</p>

<p>
Dorothy felt the red come flooding into her cheeks, while
Joel Giddings rattled obliviously along.  She did not need
to seek, to know that the voice belonged to Ried Williams.
After some inaudible response, it came again, fairly
burning into her.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps Deming never suspected&mdash;there was a good
deal he didn't know about the frame-up that Armstrong
put over.  I shouldn't wonder if he still thinks Armstrong
was his best friend that day!  It was the same day of
Dorothy's wedding, you know.  The whole affair was
mighty cleverly done, if you ask me!  No, of course she
never knew anything about it; Armstrong kept the
machinery all out of sight.  He sure did have it running
smooth, too."
</p>

<p>
The voice died away, as the speaker moved off.  Dorothy
leaned forward to see with whom Williams had been
talking, but she was too late.
</p>

<p>
Here, then, was the old dreadful thought actually put
into words!
</p>

<p>
She had never entertained a definite suspicion, despite
Macgowan's words to her before the wedding.  She had
never even dared to think of such a thing as had now been
bluntly laid before her mind.  Her first impulse was to
seek Williams, denounce him as a liar, publicly settle this
calumny before every one.  The fact that his hatred of
Armstrong still persisted, for all his hypocritical
friendliness, infuriated her.
</p>

<p>
The impulse was swiftly killed.  Doubt killed it; her
first doubt of her husband.
</p>

<p>
Her mind flew back to the wedding-day, to those words
from Macgowan, to the honeymoon and the little Armstrong
had ever said about the manner in which he had
taken over Food Products.  She found herself recalling
little things, hitherto unnoted; words, acts, looks.  Could
there be some truth, after all, in the calumny?  Had
Armstrong really put her father out of the company&mdash;was that
why he had persistently remained out?  Williams ought to
know, if any one did.
</p>

<p>
Shame flamed into her&mdash;shame, anger at herself for
allowing such thoughts entrance in her mind.  Of course it
was a lie, a calumny!  All of it!
</p>

<p>
For the remainder of that evening, Dorothy was in
turmoil.  She made no mention of all this to Armstrong.
Later, while he slept, she lay beside him wide-eyed and
sleepless, and there fought out the decision within her own
heart.
</p>

<p>
It did not occur to her that Ried Williams might have
directed those words at her ear, instead of being ignorant
that she overheard them.
</p>

<p>
It was perhaps unfortunate for Dorothy that she had
never been one of the "wise virgins" who predominate in
social life.  She was not one of those charmingly sophisticated
damsels who find in wedded life nothing very new or
startling, and who are almost as conversant with the
symptoms and experiences of motherhood before the fact as
they are after it.  Dorothy's education and nurture had
all trended in the other direction; in the direction of
old-fashioned delicacy, of hopelessly antiquated reverence for
the facts of life.  With all the charm of her upbringing,
the moderns could have argued that she had been left a
little too ignorant, for to her there were yet countless
mysteries unguessed and depths unfathomed.
</p>

<p>
Convinced of her own expectant motherhood, it was
perhaps for this reason that she found herself a prey to
shrinking timidity, to a mental fear and terror which had
small basis in actual fact.  On some unremembered
occasion, from some half-understood conversation, she had
received an implanted seed which now blossomed and bore
dark fruit.  She firmly believed that a woman in a
"delicate condition" was liable to strange mental reactions,
was subject to delusions and obsessions.  She had a terrible
fear lest some such delusion take hold upon her.
</p>

<p>
She did not know that this fear might in itself provoke
the thing that was feared.
</p>

<p>
"I must say nothing of all this to Reese," she thought,
firmly pressing the resolve into her whole self, as she lay
there staring into the darkness.  "I must dismiss it, forget
it!  I know that it is a contemptible lie.  I must never
think of it again.  It is too low, too utterly despicable, too
unclean, ever to gain harborage in my mind.  So is that
man Williams.  I shall never think of him again.  I shall
shut my mind to the whole thing; it is unworthy of me,
unworthy of Reese!  Unless I do, it may become an
obsession, it may make me cruel and unjust and may hurt
the little one&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She drew a deep breath, closed her eyes, forced herself
by sheer exertion of will into calm.  And presently she fell
asleep, secure in her resolution.
</p>

<p>
One cannot, unfortunately, altogether eject a lodger from
the cells of the brain, however unwelcome that lodger may
be, as the Freudian experiences of St. Anthony bear
witness.  Its presence may be forgotten; it may be lulled
into sleep; but no writ of ejection is valid when issued
against the brain.
</p>

<p>
Upon the following morning Deming went downtown to
take care of some last-minute purchases.  He went by
street car, since Mrs. Deming had need of the limousine to
distribute her quota of egg-nogg and fruit cake.
</p>

<p>
Dorothy was to aid in this laudable task, and Armstrong
volunteered to accompany them and to serve as burden-bearer.
It was nearly eleven when he helped the chauffeur
carry out the baskets and beribboned packages to the car.
Dorothy and her mother were already leaving the house.
</p>

<p>
A screech of brakes from the street caused Armstrong to
turn.  He saw a taxicab dash wildly to the curb before the
house, the driver snatching at a greenback extended from
the car window.  The door flew open, and a figure fairly
leaped from the cab and began to run up from the street
to the house.
</p>

<p>
"Hey, Jimmy!" shouted Armstrong in astonishment.
"Jimmy Wren!  Come around to the side!"
</p>

<p>
Wren halted, stared about, changed his direction.
Armstrong, here getting his first sight of the man's face, was
inexpressibly shocked.  Wren was white as a sheet, hollow-eyed,
upon his countenance the look of one who has been
plunged into some living hell.
</p>

<p>
"Glad to see you, Jimmy!" exclaimed Armstrong, meeting
him with extended hand.  "But what's the matter with
you, old man?  Sick?"
</p>

<p>
"Got to see you&mdash;quick&mdash;alone!" panted Wren.  Panic
was in his eyes, and fright, as they roved about.  For a
moment Armstrong thought him drunk.
</p>

<p>
"Brace up," he commanded sharply.  "Here's
Mrs. Deming&mdash;mother, this is my friend Jimmy Wren.  You've
heard me speak of him&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Wren removed his hat, mumbled something, looked at
Dorothy with terrified eyes, and then turned upon
Armstrong a glance of terrible and unutterable appeal.
</p>

<p>
"Must see you&mdash;quick!"
</p>

<p>
"I'll give up the trip," said Armstrong to Mrs. Deming.
"Something must have come up; Wren has news for me.
You'll excuse me?  Come into the house, Jimmy."
</p>

<p>
They started inside.  Dorothy, after a word to her
astonished mother, joined them in the doorway.
</p>

<p>
"I'm staying home too,"' she said simply.  "Has
something happened, Jimmy?"
</p>

<p>
Wren uttered a groan.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IX
</h3>

<p>
Jimmy Wren refused to utter a word until behind
closed doors.  Armstrong led him upstairs to the
library, while Dorothy, discovering that Wren had
eaten nothing since the previous day and had just come in
on the morning train, ordered Uncle Neb to fetch
something after them.
</p>

<p>
In the library, Armstrong procured a bottle of whisky,
poured a stiff drink for Wren, and forced him to swallow it.
Dorothy closed the doors.
</p>

<p>
"All set, Jimmy," said Armstrong, watching Wren
calmly.  "What is it?"
</p>

<p>
"Trouble," blurted Wren, desperation in his face.
"Federal investigation&mdash;indictments!  We're all going to
be indicted&mdash;you and me, all of us!  By this time there's
been a fraud order issued against us.  The business is
wrecked.  We'll be arrested&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
From Armstrong broke a laugh of angry incredulity.
</p>

<p>
"Man, are you drunk?  What's wrong with you?"
</p>

<p>
Wren stared at him from terrible eyes.
</p>

<p>
"What's wrong with me?  I don't know&mdash;except that,
maybe, I've always trusted you, Armstrong!  If you've
lied to us, deceived us, then you'll land us all in jail.
Nothing's wrong with me if&mdash;if you're straight.  Nobody
knows that except you.  Because I had faith in you,
believed in you, I came straight here&mdash;Macgowan didn't
want me to, and said he might get things settled without
bothering you&mdash;but it's gone too far.  If they close up the
business&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Armstrong's hand gripped his shoulder and set him back
in the chair from which he had half risen in his excited
burst of speech.
</p>

<p>
"Sit down, Jimmy.  There must be a cursed good explanation
of what you've just said!  Take it easy, now.  Start
at the beginning of all this nonsense.  Let's have all that
has happened.  Did Macgowan go to Washington the night
I left New York?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  He didn't know what Findlater was up to.  Nobody did."
</p>

<p>
Armstrong's eyes glinted.  "Findlater!  What's he
done?"
</p>

<p>
"I guess he was back of that letter from Seattle."
</p>

<p>
At this moment Dorothy interposed.  She had been
watching Jimmy Wren, a pallor rising in her face.  Now
she looked at Armstrong and spoke.
</p>

<p>
"What letter do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
Armstrong was burning with anxiety to hear what had
happened.  The business wrecked, indictments in the air,
Jimmy Wren in wild panic&mdash;all this meant some disaster
out of the blue.  Something inconceivable had been going
on in New York.  He was profoundly stirred by Wren's
almost incoherent words.
</p>

<p>
It was characteristic of Armstrong that, apparently cool
as ever, he now turned to Dorothy and quietly told her
of the letter Macgowan had received from Seattle.  His
poise had an immediate effect on Jimmy Wren.
</p>

<p>
"Why did you keep all that from me?" asked Dorothy.
"Did you forget that promise you made me, Reese?"
</p>

<p>
She checked herself.  Something in her eyes frightened
Armstrong; some singular quality in her voice startled
him.
</p>

<p>
"It was not worth bothering you with, dear," he
responded.  "It seemed too trivial, too small!  It was
evidently some mistake.  It's impossible that there could
be anything back of it.  Now, Jimmy&mdash;ah, here's Uncle
Neb!"
</p>

<p>
Armstrong rose, brought in the tray of food, set it before
Wren.  He returned to his own chair and lighted a cigar,
repressing his impatience anew.
</p>

<p>
"Get a bite to eat, Jimmy, and straighten up.  Then
let's have the whole thing."
</p>

<p>
Wren obeyed, for he was dominated by Armstrong.
After a few bites, he turned from the tray, to the anxious
eyes fastened upon him.
</p>

<p>
"Mac came back from Washington and said everything
was cleared up," he began, speaking more calmly now.
"Then, two days ago, Findlater came into the office and
took off the roof.  He had received a letter from Spokane,
like the one Mac got, and he also had a letter from
Washington.  It seems that his name had been used out
West, and he was wild about it&mdash;going to sue the
Armstrong Company and so forth.
</p>

<p>
"While we were arguing with him, Macgowan and I,
a postal inspector came in and ordered all our books opened
to him.  An investigation is going on this minute, Reese!
Findlater is behind it all, we think&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Hold on," cut in Armstrong coolly.  "The postal
authorities don't investigate any one without cause, Jimmy.
You know, and I know, that they have no just cause to go
after us."
</p>

<p>
"But they have!" burst out Wren.  "They have!  There
are a dozen complaints, letters from investors!  They say
the stock was misrepresented, that they've been tricked into
buying it, that it was sold them by absolute fraud!
Findlater is trying to have all the officers of the Armstrong
Company indicted for perjury and fraud; he says he'll
spend his last cent to keep his name clear of our doings!
He was going to file suit against the company when I
left&mdash;why, he told me he'd land every one of us in
jail!"
</p>

<p>
Armstrong regarded his friend with judicial calm.
</p>

<p>
"Jimmy, is everybody in the office as badly stirred up as
you are?"
</p>

<p>
"Just about."  Wren made a despairing gesture.  "Nobody
knows what to think.  Macgowan is working hard to
protect us.  Findlater swears that you've double-crossed
the company, that you've deceived every one and are
playing a crooked game&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Looks to me," said Armstrong, with a slight smile, "as
though Findlater had sort of got your goat, Jimmy!  I
suppose he's been rubbing it in pretty hard, eh?  Doing
a lot of talking, eh?  Well, you listen to me for a minute.
First, when a man talks as much as all that, he's not
particularly dangerous.  Second, what does an indictment
amount to anyway?  Not a thing.  Anybody can trump up
charges and get an indictment."
</p>

<p>
Jimmy Wren's eyes widened at this.
</p>

<p>
"But, Reese!  It means ruin&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"It means nothing," said Armstrong crisply.  "If
Findlater is out to fight us, he can't do any real harm.
What if he does get indictments issued?  He can't get
convictions&mdash;and indictments without convictions mean
absolutely nothing.  What does Mac say about it?"
</p>

<p>
"Mac is scared."
</p>

<p>
"What?"  Armstrong was astounded and showed it.
Wren continued quickly.
</p>

<p>
"Mac thinks that Findlater and his friends went to work
and procured those complaints, and are behind the whole
business.  He thinks they started the investigation."
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;did you say that Mac is scared?"
</p>

<p>
Wren nodded, miserably.  "He told me so.  That's what
got me going.  If Mac says we're up against it, then we
are!  You know it, too.  Mac says that Findlater must
have made all his plans a long time ahead, to take advantage
of your absence right now, and that he wouldn't have
started this thing unless he had the cards up his sleeve to
finish it.  I tell you, Mac is all up in the air!  By this time
a fraud order may be out against us, and if that's the case,
Findlater can get us all indicted in no time!"
</p>

<p>
Armstrong glanced at his watch.  It was eleven thirty.
He looked up, regarded Jimmy Wren with a slight smile,
and motioned toward the food.
</p>

<p>
"Eat, Jimmy; don't say another word, but listen hard.
There's a train north at twelve five, connecting at Terre
Haute with the Pennsylvania limited for New York.
You're going to be back in New York to-morrow.  I hate
to make you travel on Christmas Day, but it's got to be
done.  Eat, now, and listen."
</p>

<p>
Indescribably impressed by Armstrong's manner, dominated
by this cool refusal to find his news very terrifying,
Wren obeyed the order.  Dorothy sat in silence, her gaze
fastened upon her husband.
</p>

<p>
Armstrong went on speaking, with that same calm
deliberation which acted upon Jimmy Wren like a settling
acid that reduced all his chaotic panic to order.
</p>

<p>
"There's nothing to be worried over, Jimmy.  Stop and
think.  You'll realize that I have no secrets; the business
of the company is entirely open, and the postal inspector
is welcome to pry until Judgment Day.  The farther he
goes, the more convinced he'll be that we're all right.
</p>

<p>
"The stock has not been misrepresented by our men.
Anybody can go out and find some stockholders who can be
made to think that they've been deceived and robbed.
Findlater is a fool to start anything of this sort; he's
settled his own hash, that's all.  Don't worry about his
having any cards up his sleeve.  He has nothing, unless it's
more fraud.  You go back and tell Lawrence Macgowan to
keep his head."
</p>

<p>
Wren stared.  "Aren't you coming?"
</p>

<p>
"Later."  Armstrong smiled.  He perceived that his
own confidence and quiet certitude had already worked
wonders in Wren's heart.  "You go back and call a meeting
of the directors of Consolidated Securities for Wednesday
at eleven.  Give no reason and tell no one that you've
seen me&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But they all know I came to see you!"
</p>

<p>
"Never mind.  Keep your mouth shut, Jimmy.  Tell
Macgowan and nobody else that I shall be present at that
meeting on Wednesday morning.  I want Findlater's
resignation as president and director.  I want every share
of his stock bought up or taken away from him.  You and
Mac will use the voting trust to that end.  In the meantime,
tell Mac that if he can logically connect Findlater
with this faked-up trouble, to start suit against him for
conspiracy or anything else that's possible.  Those are
your orders."
</p>

<p>
"Good!" said Wren, his mouth full.  "Fine!  I'll do
it.  But I haven't any money, Reese; I haven't the price
of a ticket back!  I came away in a rush&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Armstrong laughed, and glanced at Dorothy.
</p>

<p>
"Dear, will you be good enough to get my pocketbook?
I think it's on the dresser."
</p>

<p>
Dorothy nodded, rose, and left the room.  Armstrong's
manner had had its effect upon her too; her pallor had
departed, and as she left, she threw a reassuring smile back
at Jimmy Wren.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the latter started, looking up at Armstrong
with new consternation.
</p>

<p>
"Reese&mdash;I forgot about it&mdash;meant to write you!  It has
nothing to do with this affair, but it's something you ought
to know.  I found it out the day after you left, while I was
going through everything, trying&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Cool off, Jimmy.  What is it?"  Armstrong passed a
cigar across the table.  "Light that first, then spill the
news.  Discovered something?"
</p>

<p>
Wren nodding, lighted his cigar.
</p>

<p>
"You remember that when we put Food Products stock
on the market, we simply went ahead and used the issue
that Deming's directors had arranged for?  They had
secured licenses from the blue sky commissioners
everywhere, you know."
</p>

<p>
Armstrong silently assented, his gaze on Wren.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I found something.  In getting those licenses,
Deming's directorate had sworn to facts regarding the
financial condition of the old company which were untrue.
About those assets we wrote off, among other things.  They
concealed the real shape of the company, in other words."
</p>

<p>
A whistle broke from Armstrong.
</p>

<p>
"Sure of that, Jimmy?"
</p>

<p>
"Positive.  Nobody knows it, and probably it won't
amount to anything.  I asked Mac about it.  He said to
keep mum; that the Armstrong Company was not involved,
and that we couldn't be held responsible for what Deming's
directors had done.  Besides, he thought there would never
be any fuss made over it."
</p>

<p>
"Mac spoke the truth that time."  Armstrong smiled.
"This is the first I ever knew of it, but there's nothing to
be done.  That directorate was a sweet bunch of crooks, all
right!  We've nothing to fear from that angle, fortunately.
Well, forget it!  You get back to New York and don't let
any one but Mac know that I'll be there Wednesday
morning."
</p>

<p>
"Throw Findlater out, eh?" queried Wren, his eyes
snapping excitedly.
</p>

<p>
"Neck and heels.  Clear into the alley."
</p>

<p>
Dorothy returned, and Armstrong handed Wren a roll of
bills.
</p>

<p>
"I've ordered a taxi," said Dorothy.  "It'll be here in
five minutes."
</p>

<p>
"Good for you, Mrs. Armstrong!"  Jimmy Wren broke
into a laugh.  "I'm mighty sorry for the way I must have
startled you.  I was in a panic, that's all."
</p>

<p>
"Got over it now?" demanded Armstrong, his eyes
twinkling.
</p>

<p>
"You bet!  I must have been a fool to let Findlater
work me up that way."
</p>

<p>
Armstrong accompanied Jimmy Wren to the station, and
saw him off.  The last state of that young man was
considerably better than the first; whereas he had arrived
an hour previously in the depths of violent and nervous
panic, he departed beaming, radiating assured optimism.
</p>

<p>
"Jimmy's all right," thought Armstrong, as he went
home from the station.  "That devil Findlater simply
knew how to drive him frantic, and did it!  No wonder the
whole office bunch is scared.  The threat of indictment is
enough to scare anybody who isn't absolutely sure of his
standing.  We'll soon show Findlater where he gets off!"
</p>

<p>
When Armstrong reached home, Dorothy was waiting for
him, and drew him back upstairs to the library.  He
perceived that she was very serious; but not until they were
alone behind the closed doors did she speak.  Then, turning
to him, she took his hands in hers and looked into his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Well?" he asked, smiling.  "Jimmy hasn't scared you, too?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  Reese, there's something I must say to you now&mdash;no,
I shan't sit on your lap!  I have to keep my head clear,
and if your arms are around me I can't think of anything
else.  Listen, dear!  Do you remember our wedding day?"
</p>

<p>
"I hope so," returned Armstrong whimsically.  "Don't you?"
</p>

<p>
But her serious, grave eyes did not respond to his
flippancy.
</p>

<p>
"Macgowan was talking to me, Reese, just before that
meeting here in the library.  He went out of his way to
say something to me that was quite needless.  Now, it
wasn't at all what he said, but what I could read in his
mind as he said it that made me afraid of him.  What he
said, made me cry.  What I could sense in his thought and
his soul, frightened me!"
</p>

<p>
Armstrong was frowning.  "Why, lady, this is the first
time you ever mentioned such a thing!  Surely Mac
didn't&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"He said nothing that was wrong, dear; but from that
day I have feared him.  Intuition, if you like.  And now
I want to warn you against him.  That man is no friend
of yours, Reese.  He's using you for his own purposes.
Don't trust him!  Don't let him know your secrets!  Be
on your guard against him, always!"
</p>

<p>
Armstrong looked into her eyes, and for a moment her
intense earnestness shook him to the very depths.  Then
his reason asserted itself.  He remembered other things.
Could this be a touch of jealousy?  It could be nothing
else.
</p>

<p>
"Dear lady," he said gently, clasping her hands in his,
"I owe a great deal to Lawrence Macgowan.  You don't
ask that I break with him sharply, for no definite reason?"
</p>

<p>
"No, no!" she said, and caught her breath.  "Oh,
Reese!  It's for your sake&mdash;that's all.  I've nothing to go
on.  I can only feel, just as I have felt from the first, that
there is something&mdash;something treacherous and deadly, in
him!  I don't want to make trouble between you.  All I
ask is that you be on your guard against him."
</p>

<p>
"Very well," said Armstrong quietly.  "I'll remember
the warning, Dot.  More than that, I can't say now.  I
need Mac now more than ever, and can't afford to break
with him.  But I'll remember your words."
</p>

<p>
As she met her husband's intent gaze, Dorothy shivered
slightly.  Perhaps she realized how terribly unreasonable
and baseless was her charge; perhaps she realized that
Armstrong could not receive it as she imparted it&mdash;that he
could not feel her aversion for Macgowan.
</p>

<p>
She knew that her warning was futile.
</p>

<p>
"Very well, dear,"' she said, and forced a smile to her
lips.  "Did I startle you?"
</p>

<p>
Armstrong nodded, gravely searching her face.  "Yes,
Dot.  I've never thought of Mac except as a trusted
confidant, a friend who would never fail me."
</p>

<p>
"There's only one person who'll never fail you, dear,"
she murmured, then started at a sound from below.
"Oh&mdash;mother's home!  Don't tell them about Jimmy Wren's
news.  It would only worry them&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Then pay me for my silence," exclaimed Armstrong
happily.
</p>

<p>
Dorothy felt again that her warning had been useless.
And she was right.  As he went downstairs, Armstrong
was thinking only of Findlater&mdash;and the following
Wednesday.

"HE WHO DID EAT OF MY BREAD"
</h2>

<h3>
CHAPTER I
</h3>

<p>
Mrs. Bird Fowler's apartment reflected, in
a high degree, the personality and beauty of its
occupant.  The large living room was chastely
but exquisitely furnished in suspiciously solid mahogany
which had, of course, belonged to Mrs. Fowler's
great-grandmother.  A portrait of the great-grandmother hung
over the black marble mantel.  Mrs. Fowler's resemblance
to that long-dead belle of the blue-grass was quite
remarkable; the same sweetly curving features, the same Grecian
profile, so purely drawn as to seem chiseled, the same rare
hazel eyes and delicately rippling brown hair.
</p>

<p>
Jimmy Wren thought of this resemblance as he looked
up at the portrait and waited.  Mrs. Fowler had been
summoned to the telephone.  He glanced around, relaxing
in the beauty and soft luxury of the room; the invisible
lighting over piano and music cabinet, the quiet tones of
walls and hangings and curtains, the few but excellent
pictures.
</p>

<p>
There was not a book in the room.  This was a point,
however, of which the usual guests were quite oblivious.
</p>

<p>
Jimmy glanced up eagerly as his hostess appeared.  She
wore white, as she usually did; and even now, on Christmas
night, she wore it with flawless taste and distinction that
set off the clear beauty of face and figure.  She came and
sat beside him, on the lounge that faced the fireplace, and
stretched forth a hand to the smoking stand.
</p>

<p>
"You'll not change your mind?" asked Jimmy Wren
pleadingly.
</p>

<p>
"Dear Jimmy, I can't!" she responded, after lighting
her cigarette and sinking back among the cushions.  "And
you may stay just half an hour and no more.  I have my
packing to do, and the train goes at midnight, you know."
</p>

<p>
"You'll let me see you off, anyhow?"
</p>

<p>
She smiled as she denied this request.  "You poor boy,
you've been traveling like mad for two days!  I want you
to go home and sleep, not come downtown and fuss around
a railroad station when we could only see each other for a
minute."
</p>

<p>
"By gad," exclaimed Wren, "I don't see why you have
to go chasing off to Tampa like this, just at the time I need
you most!  You don't know how much it means to me to
be able to come up here and talk with you&mdash;why, it gets
me into another world!  A touch of music, and your
understanding of everything&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Confession is good for the soul, they say," and she
laughed lightly.  "I don't know, for I'm such an
insignificant little person that I haven't much to confess.
No, Jimmy, I must leave for Tampa to-night; I have some
property down there that has to be attended to at once.
Why don't you take a vacation and run down to Florida
too?"
</p>

<p>
"You know why."  Jimmy Wren shook his head.
"Well, there's going to be a battle around these parts when
Armstrong comes, that's all!  You'll only be gone a couple
of weeks?  That's one good thing."
</p>

<p>
"You'll write me how things go with you?"
</p>

<p>
"You bet!  Maybe, with Armstrong and Macgowan in
action, everything will be settled very quickly.  You don't
know Macgowan?"'
</p>

<p>
"I have just met him."  Mrs. Fowler carefully shook
the ash from her cigarette.  "He seems to be a very charming
sort of man.  I know that Harry Lorenz thinks highly
of him."
</p>

<p>
"So does everybody," said Jimmy Wren.  "Even Armstrong,
who takes advice from mighty few men, listens with
all his ears to Mac."
</p>

<p>
"He's on your side in this fight, isn't he?"
</p>

<p>
"Who, Mac?  You bet he is.  I wish I could be as
certain of the outcome as Armstrong is!  There's a real
man, I tell you.  Mighty few like him alive!"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Fowler sighed.
</p>

<p>
"I wish I could encourage you, Jimmy dear," she said
softly.  "But you see, I know so much about this man
Findlater and his associates!"
</p>

<p>
"Eh?"  Jimmy Wren looked up at her.  "You know him?"
</p>

<p>
"Not personally, no.  But I do wish that you had
almost any other man in town to fight against!  They say
that Henry C. Findlater never opens battle until he has
all his wires laid&mdash;and then he simply blows up his
opponents."
</p>

<p>
"He'll have a hard job blowing us up," said Wren, but
the worried and anxious look began to creep back about his
eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Let's hope so!  You know, Jimmy, he's said to be in
pretty strong with the political crowd, both here and
upstate.  He's no giant himself, I gather, but he's in with
the big ones.  Wasn't there some story about his having
such a strong pull that he once landed a prominent banker
in the penitentiary&mdash;just because the poor man differed
with him?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," murmured Wren.  "Never heard it.
Henry C. is a poor pill, himself."
</p>

<p>
"Never underestimate an enemy, particularly in New
York, Jimmy&mdash;but there!  All this is silly.  You'll win
out, of course, and when I come home we'll celebrate the
victory.  Shall we?"
</p>

<p>
"You've said something!" declared Jimmy promptly.
"Where?  Sherry's new place?"
</p>

<p>
"Anywhere you say."  Mrs. Fowler rose.  "Now, my
dear man, I'm frightfully sorry to send you away&mdash;but I'll
look forward to seeing you again.  It was delightful of
you to devote your Christmas evening to a poor lonely&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"To a goddess, you mean," struck in Jimmy, as he rose
and took her hand in his.  Their eyes met and held, and
something that he read in those hazel depths brought the
color to Wren's cheeks.
</p>

<p>
"Good-by, and come home soon," he said unsteadily,
"and don't forget our celebration.  Oh, I do wish you
weren't going!  Won't you change your mind and stay?"
</p>

<p>
"I can't."  Her fingers tightened on his.  "But I wish
you luck and success, dear Jimmy!  And it's Christmas
night&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She leaned forward and kissed him, frankly&mdash;and Jimmy
Wren departed with a lilt of song in his heart and a shining
gladness in his eyes.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Fowler went to the telephone in her boudoir, sat
down, and called a number.
</p>

<p>
"I'd like to speak to Mr. Macgowan, please," she said
when the response came.  And, a moment later, she put
her lips to the telephone.  "Hello, Lawrence?  Is this
you?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, hello!  Merry Christmas to you!" came Macgowan's
cheerful, incisive tones.  "You don't mean that
he's back already?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  He'll see you first thing in the morning."
</p>

<p>
"Things are all right, then?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, absolutely.  There's not a shadow of suspicion
anywhere.  Henry C. is the supposed nigger in the
woodpile.  And, Lawrence, he's pitifully easy to work on;
I've got him all worked up this minute about Henry C."
</p>

<p>
"Fine!" Macgowan's chuckle came over the wire.
"Fine!  You're getting off to-night?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course."
</p>

<p>
"Well, leave the rest to me," said Macgowan.  "I'll
have him in Tampa inside of two days, and the passports
will follow as quickly as they can be rushed down there.
I'll send you a check to cover all expenses.  Work it any
way you like, but get him out of the country, understand!
A sea voyage to Spain and back will brace you up a
lot&mdash;and don't go and do anything foolish, old girl."
</p>

<p>
"You play your game as well as I play mine, and you'll
win," said Mrs. Fowler with emphasis.
</p>

<p>
"I believe you," laughed Macgowan.  "Good night, then,
and good-by!  I'll not come to see you off; he might be
hanging around.  Good-by!"
</p>

<p>
"Good-by."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Fowler hung up the receiver, and smiled into the
mirror.

<h3>
CHAPTER II
</h3>

<p>
Armstrong should have reached New York at
nine o'clock on the Wednesday following
Christmas, but his train was forty minutes late.
Dorothy had remained in Evansville, to come East in a few
days with her parents.
</p>

<p>
At precisely ten o'clock, Armstrong entered his own
office.  He sat down at his desk, shoved aside the waiting
pile of mail, drew up the telephone and asked for Jimmy
Wren.  To his astonishment, he was informed that Wren
was out of the city.
</p>

<p>
"Send Mr. Evarts here," he said curtly.
</p>

<p>
Evarts was sales manager of the Armstrong Company,
under Wren&mdash;another of Armstrong's own men, devoted to
him.  Far from being the nervous, high-strung type of
Wren, this Evarts was imperturbable, well poised,
thoroughly alert and aggressive; a good man in all respects,
and substantial.
</p>

<p>
The door opened and Evarts appeared.
</p>

<p>
"Where's Jimmy Wren?" demanded Armstrong.
</p>

<p>
Evarts closed the door behind him and stared blankly.
Then Armstrong perceived that his face was haggard,
seared with the brand of worry and of sleepless nights.
Evarts came slowly forward, his eyes fastened upon
Armstrong; that gaze betrayed a doubt, a wild anxiety,
tormenting the inner man.
</p>

<p>
"Jimmy's gone,"' he said slowly.
</p>

<p>
"Where?"
</p>

<p>
Evarts waved his hand in vague fashion.
</p>

<p>
"My heavens, chief!  Don't you know what's going on
here?  Everything's paralyzed.  No one knows what to
expect, when indictments will be&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Stop your drooling!  Where's Wren?"
</p>

<p>
"In Tampa, by this time.  On his way to Europe."
</p>

<p>
"Tampa?  Europe?"  Armstrong was astounded.
"Why, in the devil's name?"
</p>

<p>
Evarts made a desperate effort, forced himself to
comparative calmness.
</p>

<p>
"Skipped out ahead of the crash, that's all.  We're
expecting every minute to have the records seized.  Two
postal inspectors were here yesterday, going into things
with Macgowan.  The Wilmington office 'phoned in yesterday
to Wren that we could look for a fraud order to-day,
and also for indictments.  Jimmy had a conference with
Macgowan, and skipped out.  Bangs has resigned and
gone.  I've been thinking of it myself, only&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Armstrong sat back in his chair, and his eyes bit out like
steel.
</p>

<p>
"Where do you fellows think you are&mdash;in Sing Sing
already?  What's all this foolery about indictments?  You
men ought to know better.  I sent Wren back here ready to
pull off his coat and fight.  What's happened?"
</p>

<p>
Evarts hesitated, flushed, and then broke into impulsive
speech.
</p>

<p>
"You weren't here&mdash;that's the main thing!  There was
ugly talk floating all around; one report was that you had
skipped.  Nothing definite has happened; the general idea
seems to be that you're a crook, that you've floated Food
Products on a false bottom, and that there's hell to pay on
account of the way the stock's been handled by our men.
If you think it's easy for a fellow to stick around and face
indictments when the chief is gone, then think again!"
</p>

<p>
Armstrong sat motionless.  The ghastly humor of all
this brought a mirthless and angry smile to his lips.  Poor
Wren fled in blind, unreasoning panic for the second time;
Evarts in a state of funk; Bangs gone, the heads of the
organization shattered and reeling&mdash;and all because of
false rumors!  It seemed incredible.  It was incredible.
There was more in this than had appeared yet.
</p>

<p>
"What made you stick around, then?" demanded Armstrong.
</p>

<p>
"Blamed if I know," said Evarts bluntly.  "Because I
couldn't quite get you as a crook, I guess.  Wired you
twice yesterday&mdash;no answer.  I've been working like
hell, going over letters and records.  Can't find a thing
wrong.  I don't know what the postal men have found
wrong either.  But Mac says things look pretty bad for us
all."
</p>

<p>
"Mac?"  Armstrong looked up.  "Findlater, you mean.
It was Findlater who got Jimmy Wren filled up with dope.
It was Findlater who started this mess!"
</p>

<p>
Evarts lifted his brows.
</p>

<p>
"Maybe so.  But it's Mac who has done the talking, and
he's done a lot of it in the last day or two!  That's what
scared the guts out of us all.  And it's Mac who sent Wren
on to Tampa and is getting his passports to Europe."
</p>

<p>
Armstrong, bewildered and angry, held himself in check
by an effort.
</p>

<p>
"I ordered Jimmy to call a directors' meeting for eleven
to-day.  Did he do it?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Findlater mentioned it last night.  He and Mac
were talking about it."
</p>

<p>
"Evarts, either you're crazy or I am.  Your talk about
Macgowan is past me."  Armstrong reached for his
telephone.  "I'll get Mac over here and&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"He's in Findlater's office now."
</p>

<p>
"Go get him, will you?"
</p>

<p>
Evarts disappeared.  Armstrong lighted a cigar and
began to pace up and down the room, furiously
disconcerted.  He could not understand what had happened or
who was his enemy.  He was baffled.  Then the door
opened and he swung around.
</p>

<p>
On the threshold was Macgowan, debonair as ever, some
papers in his hand.  Evarts was about to enter when
Macgowan dismissed him with a gesture.  Armstrong promptly
interfered.
</p>

<p>
"Hold on!  Evarts, come along in.  Now, Mac, what's
been going on here?"
</p>

<p>
"Reese, this is something for private discussion&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Not by a damned sight!  I've nothing to discuss in
private," exploded Armstrong.  "You come in, Evarts.
Now, Mac, let's have the whole thing."
</p>

<p>
After momentary hesitation, Macgowan shrugged
slightly and came forward to the desk.  He calmly drew up
a chair and seated himself, disposed his papers before him,
and produced a cigar and lighted it.  Then, casually
looking up, he invited Armstrong to be seated.
</p>

<p>
In this instant, Armstrong beheld a new Lawrence
Macgowan.
</p>

<p>
Gone was all the genial amiability of the man.  Gone
was the brilliant warmth from his eyes, now cold and hard
and piercing, bitterly masterful.  Out of those eyes there
looked the real Macgowan&mdash;a predatory, merciless man of
steel and iron, armed and ready for battle.
</p>

<p>
The sight of this face struck Armstrong like a blow.  He
sat down, wondering yet not suspecting.
</p>

<p>
"I thought, Mac, that you had attended to this Washington
investigation?"
</p>

<p>
"I did.  If you want it straight, I caused it."
</p>

<p>
As he spoke, Macgowan met the gaze of Armstrong with
a cold, sneering challenge in his eyes.  The deliberate
cruelty of that regard, its insolent brutality, gave
Armstrong a swift premonition of the truth, staggered him with
its force.  Macgowan went on smoothly.
</p>

<p>
"You know there's a meeting of the directors of
Consolidated at eleven, Reese."  His voice was level,
unimpassioned, stinging.  "Here are two papers which I
wish to lay before the board for immediate action, if you'll
kindly sign them."
</p>

<p>
Armstrong looked at the typed sheets which were slid
over the desk to him.  He read the words.  Incredulity
gripped him; he read them again, his brain whirling.
Anger surged up in him, he was stupefied by a frightful
bewilderment.
</p>

<p>
One of those papers was his resignation as a director of
Consolidated.  The other was a cancellation of the contract
by which the Armstrong Company was handling Food
Products stock.
</p>

<p>
He lifted an uncomprehending gaze to Macgowan.
</p>

<p>
"Mac&mdash;what sort of a joke is this?"
</p>

<p>
"No joke," came the inflexible answer.  It was smoothly
deliberate, that voice.  But the eyes that met Armstrong&mdash;the
eyes were terrible!  "No joke at all, Reese.  Unless
you sign here and now, this letter goes out to-day.  You
had better read it carefully."
</p>

<p>
He placed a third paper in front of Armstrong.  The
latter mechanically picked it up, read it through with
blundering senses.  From the corner, Evarts looked on
wide-eyed, not understanding, yet gripped by the scene.
</p>

<p>
The letter was signed by Macgowan and Findlater, as
attorney and president of Consolidated Securities.  It was
addressed to the commissioner of securities of Ohio, related
various complaints of the manner in which Food Products
stock had been handled by the Armstrong Company, and
charged misrepresentation and fraud on the part of that
company.  It went on to demand a full investigation, a
withdrawal of the license granted Armstrong in Ohio, and
full penalties.
</p>

<p>
"We have affidavits to back up these complaints," went
on that deadly voice.  "A Federal investigation is under
way; I caused it, being satisfied that you were playing
crooked.  A fraud order will be issued against you to-day
at my request."
</p>

<p>
He paused an instant, then proceeded slowly, giving full
force to his words.
</p>

<p>
"To protect ourselves against you, Consolidated is forced
to take this step.  This letter and similar ones will go out
to every state in which the Armstrong Company operates.
We demand full publicity.  The alternative is your
resignation&mdash;now.  Either resign, or we show you up to the
whole country as a crook."
</p>

<p>
Armstrong stared at the letter.  He was dazed, shocked
into chaotic bewilderment.
</p>

<p>
"But this isn't true!  It's damnably false!"  Then he
looked up into those brilliant, pitiless eyes that bored into
him, and read the bitter truth.  A hoarse cry broke from
him.  "You&mdash;Judas!  Judas!"
</p>

<p>
The word died on his lips.  Too late, he saw himself
betrayed, lured to destruction by this man whom he had
trusted.  A spasm of fury seized him.  He crushed the
letter into his pocket, half rose from his chair; his hands
darted out toward Macgowan, a madness of rage blinding
him&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Barely in time, he mastered himself, controlled the
impulse, sank back into his chair.  Perhaps it was not wholly
true, not so bad as he thought.  Perhaps Macgowan was
sincere.
</p>

<p>
"You can't mean this, Mac!"  That hurt and stricken
voice made the other man wince for an instant.  "You
know how false all these charges are.  If that letter went
out&mdash;why, it'd mean ruin for me, no matter how it ended!
That letter, sent out by my own company, would finish me!
You haven't betrayed me, Mac?  You're not trying to
chuck me out&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You poor hick!"  Macgowan took this appeal for weakness.
His voice seared like acid.  "We're tired of your
altruistic vaporings.  We've endured your bombastic
dreams long enough.  We're going to take over this
concern on a business basis.  Here's another paper you may
also sign; an agreement to turn over your Consolidated
stock to us.  The best thing you can do is to fade out
quietly.  This meeting at eleven will blow you up if you
don't."
</p>

<p>
Armstrong quivered under the scornful words.  Then,
raging, he came to his feet.
</p>

<p>
"All right!  Let's have the meeting&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Macgowan's cold smile froze the speech on his lips.
</p>

<p>
"Reese, I'll vote your stock in the best interest of the
company.  I have Jimmy Wren's resignation as secretary.
He has empowered me to assume his interest in the
voting trust, though I don't need it, since I'll vote with
Findlater."
</p>

<p>
The voting trust!  Armstrong sank back into his chair,
doubting no longer; and the will to fight broke asunder
within him.  Macgowan had betrayed him, with deliberate
cold-blooded planning.  Armstrong could not vote his own
stock.  Though Macgowan and Findlater together could
control the voting trust.  Jimmy Wren was safely out of the
way&mdash;got rid of!  Armstrong had been stripped of every
helper, every aid.
</p>

<p>
From this instant, Reese Armstrong felt himself lost
beyond recovery.  He had been lured into a trap from which
there was no escape, no possible rescue.  A frightful
despair overwhelmed him&mdash;it was Macgowan who had done
this thing.  Macgowan!  There was the paralyzing factor.
</p>

<p>
Not the lies, not the hatred and intrigue, not the threats
and falsity around him, could prevail&mdash;but the treachery
of his friend.  A profound melancholy gripped him, and
he could not fight it away.  Oblivious of those cruelly
exultant eyes across the desk, oblivious of the wondering
stare of Evarts, he lowered his head and stared at the
papers before him, with eyes that saw not.
</p>

<p>
He was absolutely in the power of Macgowan; there was
no hope, for he had depended upon nobody else.  Macgowan,
joined to Findlater, held him powerless.  Trusted
and given authority, Macgowan could ruin him&mdash;had
already done so!  Swung against him, the voting trust
would smash him, and that letter from the directors would
make his ruin public.
</p>

<p>
It was the deliberate treachery which struck Armstrong
as no other blow could have done.  It reached into his
very soul like a hot brand, burning everything in its course.
His brain was in chaos.  He could think of nothing coherent,
could plan nothing, could find no evasion.  He sat
broken, his senses reeling, his ability numbed and stupefied.
And Macgowan, watching with the cruel eyes of a hawk,
smiled upon the ruin of the man whose friend he had been,
and knew the moment had come to strike.
</p>

<p>
"Sign!" said the inflexible voice.  "Sign&mdash;or take your
medicine!  Time's up."
</p>

<p>
Armstrong lifted his head.  Sign!  He could do nothing
else.  He was lost.  Everything was in the grip of
Macgowan.  Out of his own soul all the fight had been crushed.
With fumbling hands, he groped at the papers.  Anguish
blinded him, a bitter surge of despair held him fettered.
He had no heart left to struggle, or even to evade; he
could do nothing, for his spirit was broken.  He felt a pen
thrust into his fingers, and blindly scrawled his name
across the papers.  Then he relaxed and sat with chin
fallen on breast.
</p>

<p>
Macgowan, smiling thinly, gathered up the papers and
left the room.
</p>

<p>
Armstrong did not see the man go.  He sat as in a
daze, seeing nothing.  Somewhere in the back of his brain
was throbbing that warning which Dorothy had tried to
impress upon him; the memory only served to make worse
the hurt.
</p>

<p>
Then, suddenly, he was aware of a hand that clutched
his arm, a voice ringing in his ear.  He looked up, dully,
to see Evarts standing over him in a blaze of excitement.
</p>

<p>
"Armstrong!  I see the whole thing now&mdash;it can't end
like this, it can't!" Evarts cried out the words in frantic
tones.  "Wake up, man!  Do something&mdash;don't sit there
like a fool!  Oh, why the devil did you sign those papers!
Wake up, chief, I'm with you!  I'll stick till hell freezes
over!  Wake up and tell me what to do."
</p>

<p>
Armstrong struggled to his feet.  He swayed, caught at
the desk, gathered himself together.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing to do, Evarts," he said, mumbling the words
miserably.  "Nothing to do.  I'm sick.  Let me get out
of here&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Somehow he took his hat and coat and got out of the
room, which had suddenly become hateful to him.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER III
</h3>

<p>
Armstrong went to his hotel room and dropped
into a chair.  He felt the need of being alone.
He was glad that Dorothy was in Evansville,
ignorant of all this disaster.  He wanted no sympathy, no
loving touch; he was in too bitter a mood.
</p>

<p>
The hours following his interview with Macgowan were
the darkest of his life.  Now that it was all over, the
reaction hit him hard.  The absolute and deliberate
falseness of his most trusted friend was so deadly and
incredible that his brain was slow to waken.  This
wormwood was a drug, numbing all his senses save that of
inward torture.  Every thought of Macgowan was a new
stab.
</p>

<p>
Financially he was little injured; the blow went deeper.
He was stripped of all interest in Consolidated.
Everything to which he had given his energy and thought was
lifted out of his grasp.  He was left with nothing.  To all
that body of nearly sixteen thousand investors whose
confidence had so inflated his pride&mdash;he was now less than
nothing.
</p>

<p>
Dorothy's warning recurred to him, wrenched a wondering
groan from his spirit.  How those clear, cool eyes
of her had pierced to the rotten heart of Macgowan!  If
he had only heeded it&mdash;if he had only received it sooner!
Armstrong dropped his face in his hands, fighting desperately
if unavailingly for a foothold on sanity, for a clear
brain.  He could find no outstanding point, nothing on
which to build; tumult and chaos still engulfed him, and
the will to do was dead.  He could think only of Lawrence
Macgowan, and his soul was plunged into a frightful
despair.
</p>

<p>
Slowly he realized what he had lost; slowly he came to a
comprehension of how this astounding treachery had won
the fight against him.  Now that everything was finished,
he could by degrees perceive what a frightful act of folly
he had that morning committed.  With a perfectly clean
conscience, with nothing whatever to fear&mdash;why, why had
he not made some semblance of a fight?  His act in signing
those papers had been the act of a coward, a fool!  He
shivered at thought of himself that morning, shivered at
the remembrance of what he had passed through.
</p>

<p>
Macgowan, with superb craft and diabolical certainty,
had counted on that very thing, of course; had delivered
blow upon blow, each following close upon the quivering
impact of the other; had in fact brought his whole
campaign of treachery to a culmination, had won everything,
almost before Armstrong so much as knew himself in
danger.  Oh, clever, infernally clever, Macgowan!  How
cunningly he had planned, knowing that Armstrong would
be stunned, rendered incapable of fighting, at a loss to do
anything!  It was the voting trust, of course, which had
served as the final weapon&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Armstrong started suddenly.  How far back did this
duplicity extend?  How long had Macgowan been concerting
his treachery around his control of the voting trust?
</p>

<p>
This thought electrified him, sent his brain reaching out
at last.  The terrible conviction grew upon him that he had
been duped from the start, tricked and played as a pawn
from the very outset of his career in New York!  All this
while, he had been building up a business system in order
that Macgowan, sitting back and watching, might grab it
when the time came.
</p>

<p>
And the time had come.  Consolidated had slipped from
his grasp.  Macgowan had set that brain of his to making
his own fortune.
</p>

<p>
Armstrong sat staring before him, fingers twisting and
gripping, his face seamed with drawn lines.  All the cheerful,
genial youth of him was crying out in agony of its hurt
from a friend's hand; all the man of him was wrenched
by the realization that another would reap where he had
sowed, that he was in a moment robbed and despoiled of an
institution to which he had dedicated his future life.  The
same stern self-repression which that morning had kept
him from gripping Macgowan by the throat, now held him
motionless, his body relaxed, his brain at work.
</p>

<p>
Another man would have cursed.  Reese Armstrong
thought.
</p>

<p>
One thing after another&mdash;petty and hitherto unregarded
details uprose before his mind's eye in damning surety.
How Macgowan had done this, had done that; how, for
example, that voting trust had been renewed.  Little
things, yet all combining to show that Macgowan had
planned his coup long ago.  His confidence in Armstrong
had been sincere; he had believed that Consolidated would
succeed.  Therefore he had laid his schemes, looking to the
time when he might seize Consolidated.
</p>

<p>
And now he had gripped his prey.  But&mdash;why?
</p>

<p>
That pretended distrust of Findlater and the other men!
Armstrong flinched at the recollection.  Even now,
Macgowan and Findlater were chortling together over their
easy conquest.  All the time they had been playing a deep
and crafty game, those two.
</p>

<p>
But&mdash;to what end?
</p>

<p>
Armstrong stiffened, as the truth smashed him squarely
between the eyes.  They had driven him out, they had
shorn him of his power in Consolidated, they had
bludgeoned his chief men and his sales organization&mdash;why?
So that they could loot, of course.  They had let him put
Consolidated squarely on its feet.  Now they would reap
the benefit, careless of what later happened, careless
whether Consolidated blew up, so long as they could
loot&mdash;loot!
</p>

<p>
And what would they loot?  Not Consolidated alone.
Not one solitary financial concern.  This institution stood
not by itself, but in it were bound up the faith and
backing of sixteen thousand people.  The company would be
looted, and these investors would be looted.  And these
people had thought that their money would be handled
conservatively, not juggled and played with!
</p>

<p>
A shiver passed through Armstrong's body.  Then his
wide eyes came back to normal; his tensed muscles relaxed.
A long breath came into his lungs.  He had found the
thing he needed, the mental spur, the point of departure.
</p>

<p>
Macgowan had not waged his treacherous fight for the
control of Consolidated Securities alone; not alone had he
won the fat corporate funds, the subsidiary companies, the
money-making powers.  This crafty lawyer, who had not
invested a single cent, had also captured sixteen thousand
people, men and women&mdash;and they would be milled,
robbed, looted to the very limit!
</p>

<p>
Armstrong had fought hard to gain the trust of these
people.  He had expended untold energy and money to win
their faith.  He had felt them behind him, the thrust of
their will and faith driving him onward with assured
confidence.  And now, now!  They would see in the
newspapers that he was out of Consolidated.  Within a few
short weeks or months they would find themselves helpless,
prostrate, unable to prevent the looting.  Their very
faith in Consolidated would be used to rob them.
</p>

<p>
It was not what they would think of him that so stung
Armstrong, that stirred him into life and action, that
wakened the numbed spirit in him.  It was the thought of
what would happen to them.  He knew well what would
happen, with Macgowan's smoothly accurate hand at the
wheel.  He saw Macgowan in a new light, now.  Their
fate would be as his own&mdash;betrayed before they knew it.
And who would fight for them?
</p>

<p>
A slow, bitter smile curled Armstrong's lips.
</p>

<p>
"Who will fight for them?  Who can fight for them?
One man, who failed to put up a fight for himself.  One
poor dupe, smashed like a rotten reed, wrecked largely by
his own folly!  But, by the lord, I'll do it!  My own hand
is lost.  I can't win back what I've thrown away.  But I
can fight for the people who trusted me."
</p>

<p>
Then, for an instant, he faltered.
</p>

<p>
Again a memory of the little things, the tricks and sly
snares, rose up to jeer at him.  He recalled now how
insistently Macgowan had prevented his bringing Robert
Dorns into the affair of that Seattle letter&mdash;with good
reason!  Dorns would have discovered the truth, would
have spoiled all the culminative effect of Macgowan's
carefully planned surprise blow.  And how smoothly had
Macgowan averted that danger, only to go to Washington and
start his campaign?
</p>

<p>
So, Armstrong faltered.  How could he fight, after all?
He was alone, powerless, stripped of all connection with
Consolidated.  He had even agreed to sell his stock to
Macgowan; unless he broke this agreement, he had nothing
to fight with.  A struggle now would mean battle to the
death, without quarter; a battle of lies and deceit and
powerfully entrenched men against one man who had
nothing at his back.  Nothing?  Ah!  This one man had
behind him the faith of sixteen thousand people.  Was that
a little thing?  "If ye have faith as a grain of mustard
seed ... nothing shall be impossible!"
</p>

<p>
Suddenly Armstrong rose to his feet, laughed almost
happily, and glanced at his watch.  He crossed the room
to the wall telephone.
</p>

<p>
Three minutes later he had declared war.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
</h3>

<p>
Late in the afternoon of this same fateful
Wednesday, Armstrong sat across the desk from
that hard-jawed, hard-eyed old man, head of the
Dorns Detective Agency, and told his story.
</p>

<p>
From the walls around looked down the pictured features
of princes and artists, men of wealth or dignity,
distinguished folk in all walks of life.  These pictures were
inscribed to the hard-eyed old man behind the desk&mdash;Robert
Dorns.  Some of them he had protected, some of
them he had saved, some of them he had merely served.
For this man, whose name had been famous for a generation
past, life had no illusions whatever; the husks of
pretense were stripped away before that bitter eye of his,
and he perceived only realities.
</p>

<p>
Behind that powerful, almost brutal, face was a head of
intellectual power.  In that brain reposed secrets
unguessed, facts which, if revealed, would menace and shake
the structure of politics and finance.  This man would
never have the satisfaction of writing his memoirs; for his
memoirs, if written, would betray the world.
</p>

<p>
Armstrong was in this office for an hour.  In that hour,
he accomplished the greatest feat of his career&mdash;a feat
which few other men could have duplicated.  In the face
of every cynical doubt and mistrust which must have
attacked his listener, he "sold" Robert Dorns, absolutely
and beyond cavil.  He used no appeals, made no arguments,
until he had told his story.  Dorns, chewing on a
cigar, said not a word until Armstrong had finished.
Then:
</p>

<p>
"Going through with it for the sake of the investors,
huh?  Who's paying the cost of the fight&mdash;if you win?"
</p>

<p>
"I am," said Armstrong.  "I'll make it plain that I'm
not fighting to get any office in Consolidated; I want none.
My stock will give me control, and that's all I want&mdash;unless
I have to turn over that stock.  But that stock is
tied up for another three months in the voting trust,
Macgowan must be blocked somehow."
</p>

<p>
"Humph!" grunted Dorns, the hard eyes boring into
him.  "D'you know that you're up against a real fight?
You are, me lad; no mistake about it.  This bird
Macgowan, now&mdash;I know him.  He's hand in fist with
Tammany, and likewise with Albany; any lad who can play
both ends o' that game is a slick one!  What've ye got to
fight him with?"
</p>

<p>
"The trust that sixteen thousand people have in me,"
said Armstrong simply.
</p>

<p>
The bitter eyes stared at him, a slow wonder stirring
in their depths.  Then came a startling and incredible
speech.
</p>

<p>
"Either you're a damned fool&mdash;or you're somethin' big.
And you're no fool, me lad.  I'm with you, win, lose or
draw.  If we lose, I'll take no fee; you're the first man in
years who has come for my help in an unselfish cause.
I'm with you, and I'm damned proud to be with you, me
lad!"
</p>

<p>
Armstrong had not expected such a speech.  The
unsuspected quality he had evoked from this man left him
wordless, unable to respond.
</p>

<p>
"Now," said Dorns with his incisive crispness, "are you
going into this thing alone?"
</p>

<p>
"Not if I can help it."  Armstrong smiled faintly.
"I've learned my lesson.  I'll need all the assistance I can
get."
</p>

<p>
"You'll want the best lawyer in the city.  Got anybody?"
</p>

<p>
Armstrong shook his head.  "I'm a lawyer, but not in
Macgowan's class."
</p>

<p>
"You'll take my advice?"
</p>

<p>
"I didn't come here to talk baseball."
</p>

<p>
Dorns grinned at that, and turned to his desk telephone.
He called a number.
</p>

<p>
"Robert Dorns talking; give me Mr. Mansfield," he
said curtly.  Then, after a pause: "Hello!  This you,
Q. Adams?  Dorns on the wire.  Say, did you ever know
me to go wrong on a man?"
</p>

<p>
He paused, chuckled, then went on:
</p>

<p>
"I'm sending a man up to see you.  Name's Armstrong.
It ain't law he needs; he's a lawyer himself.  What he
needs is you, and all you got!  Him and you and I are
going to bust Lawrence Macgowan.  Think we can do it?"
</p>

<p>
He glanced over the instrument at Armstrong, a
whimsical glance, and grinned.
</p>

<p>
"Willin' to try the impossible, huh?  All right.  When
and where?"
</p>

<p>
An instant later he grunted, pushed aside the telephone,
swung his chair around, and faced Armstrong.
</p>

<p>
"You go see Quincy Adams Mansfield at seven o'clock,
Union League Club, and talk to him like you've just talked
to me, see?  Now let's get to work, me lad.  This man of
yours, Wren.  Where is he?"
</p>

<p>
"Tampa.  Macgowan has him on the way to Europe."
</p>

<p>
"Want him back?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"He'll be here on the next train.  What's my first job?"
</p>

<p>
"Go after this fool investigation," said Armstrong
promptly.  "Macgowan started it as part of the scheme to
scare me.  Kill it."
</p>

<p>
"I'll take care of that," said Dorns grimly.  "This bird
has sent around to a bunch of stockholders and persuaded
'em to sign affidavits; it's easy done, me lad.  Sell a man a
ten-dollar gold piece for a dollar, and somebody can make
him think he's been swindled.  Now, I'll handle this with
Q. Adams, and we'll see it through.  Your letter files,
instructions to agents, and a few questions to the
disgruntled guys&mdash;it's a pipe!  I'll knock that investigation
sky high.  What next?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know yet," said Armstrong.  "The annual
meeting of Consolidated will take place the first Monday in
April&mdash;the third.  The voting trust will have expired
then."
</p>

<p>
"You'll not turn over your stock to Macgowan, as you
agreed?"
</p>

<p>
"No!"  Armstrong's jaw set.  "The agreement was
signed through fraud.  I'll refuse to keep it.  If I kept
it, Consolidated would be absolutely gone!"
</p>

<p>
"Humph!  In three months he can loot hell out of the
company anyhow.  Now, I want some operatives scattered
through that place of yours by to-morrow night.  Who
does the hiring, anybody you can trust?  I want to keep
tabs on Macgowan."
</p>

<p>
Armstrong mentioned Evarts, who would be able to place
the operatives.
</p>

<p>
"All right.  Now, what you got to be afraid of in the
past?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing."
</p>

<p>
"Aw, come clean!  Macgowan is goin' to rake hell with
a fine-toothed comb the minute he gets wise that you're
after him.  Where'd you come from?  Ever arrested?"
</p>

<p>
Armstrong laughed.  "No."
</p>

<p>
He gave a brief sketch of his life to date.  When he had
finished, Dorns nodded.
</p>

<p>
"You're lucky, me lad.  Well, I guess we're all set to
go!  Work out some plan of action with Mansfield.  When
I get Wren here, we'll start to use our heads; meantime,
get Q. Adams to work."
</p>

<p>
Armstrong had entered Robert Dorns' office with the
feeling of a crushed and overwhelmed man fighting
against fate.  He left with something of his old self
restored.  Once more he was cool, level-headed, clear-brained.
He was no longer daunted by his situation.  The
worst of the blow was past; now there remained to fight.
</p>

<p>
At seven that evening, he entered the Union League
Club.  Mansfield joined him in the reception room, shook
hands, and led him to the elevator.
</p>

<p>
"Come to one of the library rooms, where we can talk in
peace."
</p>

<p>
In the small, narrow room where books crowded to the
ceiling, Mansfield took one of the easy chairs across from
Armstrong.  Between them was the glass-topped table with
its bronze fittings, its racks of writing equipment.
Mansfield laid down cigars, settled himself comfortably.
</p>

<p>
"I'm ready," he said laconically.
</p>

<p>
Following the advice of Dorns, Armstrong repeated his
tale as told to the detective, giving his story completely
and briefly.  He realized that Mansfield was studying him
the while, though he could not tell what impressions the
man gained.
</p>

<p>
Quincy Adams Mansfield, one of the most celebrated yet
least-known attorneys of the city, with a practice that was
very exclusive, was a non-committal person.  His manners
were like Findlater's: authoritative, impervious, slightly
offish.  The great width of the eyes and brow, however,
showed quite another sort of man here, and the steady gaze
was deliberate and judicial.  He said not a word until
Armstrong had concluded.  Then he spoke quietly.
</p>

<p>
"That letter which Macgowan threatened to send out.
You haven't it, I suppose?"
</p>

<p>
When Armstrong felt in his pockets, Mansfield's brows
lifted.  He took the letter, glanced over it, then looked up.
For the first time, his features warmed in the semblance
of a smile.
</p>

<p>
"I congratulate you on the possession of this letter," he
said drily.
</p>

<p>
"Why?  It was only by chance that I retained it."
</p>

<p>
"Really?"  Mansfield laughed a little.  "The cleverest
man is bound to slip up; it is astonishing that Macgowan
let you keep this letter.  With it to aid us, we shall apply
for the removal of Macgowan, Findlater and these other
men from the control of Consolidated Securities, and
ultimately we shall jail them for conspiracy and criminal
extortion."
</p>

<p>
Armstrong started.  Fool that he was to call himself a
lawyer!  Undoubtedly this letter was actionable, yet he
had preserved it by the merest chance.  And Macgowan
had been so filled with triumph that he had overlooked&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"It is regrettable," came the precise voice of Mansfield,
"that you allowed yourself to be coerced, but I can quite
understand your situation.  There is no doubt that the
charge of fraud and misrepresentation can be met by
your own documents, and the testimony of your subordinates?"'
</p>

<p>
"None.  There's absolutely no ground for complaint
from any investor.  Put a few on the stand and you'll see
how quickly they'll backwater."
</p>

<p>
"Then you have virtually nothing to fear from that
quarter."  Mansfield tapped his pince-nez on his fingers,
reflectively.  "You will not make delivery of your
Consolidated stock to Macgowan, naturally; an agreement
made under duress is not binding, legally or morally.
Macgowan, in the face of our charges, will not dare to force a
delivery."
</p>

<p>
"But will a jury believe," queried Armstrong, "that I'd
be fool enough to submit to extortion, when I was perfectly
innocent?"
</p>

<p>
The lawyer smiled, as though from a weary knowledge
of mankind.
</p>

<p>
"My dear sir, that action was forced by Macgowan's
control of the voting trust; and, further, by your state of
mind upon discovery of his treachery.  Every man in the
world has at some time been betrayed by the friend he
trusted; such, at least, is the supposition upon which I shall
go.  One or two men on a jury will certainly have had
such an experience."
</p>

<p>
Armstrong nodded, then produced an evening paper.
"Here's a little matter&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He found the column which he had marked, and handed
it to Mansfield, who read over carefully a report of the
special meeting of Consolidated's directors that morning.
The resignations of both Wren and Armstrong had been
promptly acted upon, and a shift of officers had taken
place, leaving Findlater as president but putting in
Macgowan as secretary and treasurer.  Mansfield returned the
paper without comment.
</p>

<p>
"You think we have a chance to win, then?" asked
Armstrong.
</p>

<p>
"Some day&mdash;yes."  Mansfield frowned.  "That phrase
covers a good deal of time, Mr. Armstrong.  We shall have
to meet every legal twist and turn, every subterfuge, every
possible form of corruption, even; further, we shall find
strong political influence arrayed against us.  The petition
for removal of Macgowan and Findlater must go before
the state's attorney general at once.  In the end, we shall
win."
</p>

<p>
"In the end!" repeated Armstrong, dismayed.  "But
before April third, at least?"
</p>

<p>
"Not before April of next year, or the next, or perhaps
the year after," declared the lawyer gravely.  "You may
expect to be attacked most bitterly in every possible
quarter.  Macgowan may even manage to have that voting
trust continued after its expiration, I warn you.  But, if
I find things as you have related them, we shall ultimately
break this man Macgowan.  Do you wish to go ahead?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Armstrong.  "Do you wish to handle the
case, and also to act as counsel for me in general?"
</p>

<p>
"I should esteem it a privilege," said Quincy Adams
Mansfield.  "What is your plan of campaign?"
</p>

<p>
Until this moment, Armstrong had entertained no plan.
But now:
</p>

<p>
"I'll establish the Armstrong Company in new offices,
across the street from Consolidated.  I'll open a fight upon
the present directorate, as soon as Dorns learns what
they're doing.  A good many of my own men over there
will resign when they discover what's taken place&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"One moment, please," intervened Mansfield.  "Didn't
you mention Judge Holcomb as one of your directors?"
</p>

<p>
"Ostensibly, yes.  He has never taken a very active
part in affairs.  He is elderly, and has rather given up
active business."
</p>

<p>
A singular smile twisted the lawyer's lips.
</p>

<p>
"I know Judge Holcomb very well, Mr. Armstrong; we
are friends of long standing.  Old as he is, no man has a
more reputable position, and no man can fight harder.  I
suggest that the entire truth be laid before him at once,
and his help invited by you."
</p>

<p>
"I'll do it," assented Armstrong.  "Now, I propose
making an active campaign to reach each individual
investor in Consolidated Securities.  Of course, I have as
yet no direct proof that Macgowan and his friends mean to
loot the company; once that proof is secured, I'll go ahead
strong."
</p>

<p>
Mansfield nodded.  "Very well.  Get your campaign
mapped out and make all your plans.  I shall see Robert
Dorns when he gets this man Wren back to town, and we
shall decide upon things.  Until you hear from us, secure
Judge Holcomb to our side and await events."
</p>

<p>
Armstrong returned to his hotel feeling rejuvenated, a
new man in very fact.  The sense of crushing defeat was
clean gone from him.  True, the defeat was no less severe,
yet the sting was out of it.  Now he would fight!
</p>

<p>
He went to bed and slept, a smile upon his lips.  When
he wakened, it was to see Dorothy at his bedside, sitting
there watching him.  He stared dazedly, then sat up in
astounded wonder.
</p>

<p>
"A telegram came from Evarts just after you left for
New York," she said quietly.  "I read it, and knew there
was trouble.  So I came."
</p>

<p>
"Thank God for you!" said Armstrong, and pressed her
fingers to his lips.  "Yesterday I&mdash;I was glad you were
not here.  But now I can tell you about it."
</p>

<p>
"Let's go home first, dear."
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap0205"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER V
</h3>

<p>
Within four days, the Armstrong Company was
established in new offices directly across the
street from the stronghold of Consolidated
Securities.  The separation was not accomplished without
pain, and considerable effort as well.
</p>

<p>
There was no objection from Consolidated; could be
none.  Bickering in the parlor was echoed below-stairs,
however; a violent controversy raged through the offices
between Armstrong's men and those whom Macgowan had
attached to himself.  Among these latter, Armstrong found
some of his own experts ranked.  His disillusionment was
rapidly becoming complete.
</p>

<p>
Judge Holcomb, being made acquainted with full details,
quietly resigned from the directorate of Consolidated; an
occurrence which, though passing without great comment,
was destined to have momentous results later.
</p>

<p>
Jimmy Wren returned.  He was contrite and exceedingly
ashamed of his flight, without knowing exactly how
it had come about, except that Macgowan's suggestions
had prevailed.  When he learned all that had happened,
he set forth to hammer Macgowan with his fists; Armstrong
checked this impulse with peremptory words, and Wren
soon forgot past things in a furious rush of work that
lasted into the next week.  Indeed, this work involved in
the change of offices was a godsend to Armstrong himself.
For, even following Wren's return, he heard nothing from
either Dorns or Mansfield.  When he impatiently called up
Mansfield, he was told to be patient and wait for further
notice.  And the notice did not come.
</p>

<p>
This silence endured over the week-end and New Year's
Day.  To Armstrong, the suspense of those few days at
length became horrible.  The mere fact that he was doing
nothing, taking no action against Macgowan, grew
portentous in his mind beyond its true value.  He could work
out no plan of campaign until hearing further from Mansfield
and Dorns; meantime, he had made a dozen plans and
could go ahead with none of them.
</p>

<p>
Doubts assailed him, strange doubts and suspicions of
those two men.  The deliberate unmasking of Macgowan
had shaken his faith, shaken his confidence in himself and
in his judgment of other men.  He began to imagine that
Dorns had lied to him, that Mansfield lacked interest.
Perhaps Macgowan had approached them!  This last
thought terrified him.
</p>

<p>
Nor was it an inconceivable thought.  He knew now
what had been going on during his absence in Evansville
over Christmas.  Nothing was seen of any postal inspectors
at the new offices, nothing further was heard of any
proceedings; yet Macgowan had set that investigation afoot,
had caused it in Washington.  The letter from Seattle had
been a blind, a mere nothing, written at Macgowan's
dictation.  Armstrong was rapidly getting a true focus on
the <i>modus operandi</i> of his former friend.
</p>

<p>
With work to occupy him, Armstrong was all right; out
of the office, he became a prey to despondency.  His
initiative was blocked.  He brooded over the silence of
Dorns and Mansfield, tried to force his mind to other
things, and succeeded only indifferently.  In those black
days it was Dorothy who kept him balanced, who restored
the threatened loss of control and poise, devoting herself
to meeting the danger.  She kept his thoughts off
Macgowan as much as possible.  Before the arrival of her
parents for a short visit preceding their trip to Europe,
she insisted that Armstrong make no mention to the
Demings of his altered affairs.
</p>

<p>
"But I'd like to have your father's advice, Dot!" he
expostulated.
</p>

<p>
"You'll get advice from Dorns in due time."  She saw
his face darken at this, and went hurriedly on.  "Besides,
father would give up his trip and stay right here to fight
it out beside you&mdash;and he must have the voyage.  He
needs the vacation; he needs to learn all over how to play.
And I don't want their visit spoiled by a lot of worry,
dear; we want them to have a good time."
</p>

<p>
"All right," agreed Armstrong.  "We'll say nothing
about it all."  Yet he was aware that Dorothy's pleading
was largely for his own sake, and to keep him off the
subject while at home.
</p>

<p>
On the following Monday, Armstrong received a telephone
request from Mansfield that he send Wren over to
the latter's office at once.  The lawyer was curt and
noncommittal, or so Armstrong fancied.  Wren did not return
before Armstrong left for home, nor was there any chance
to see Wren in the morning, for the Demings were to arrive
by an early train and Armstrong motored in with Dorothy
to meet them.  His worry had redoubled.
</p>

<p>
The train was late.  Armstrong left Dorothy at the
train exit and went to a telephone booth.  He called the
office, discovered that Jimmy Wren was out&mdash;and that
Robert Dorns had left a call there for him.  Two minutes
later he thrilled to the voice of Dorns.
</p>

<p>
"Hello, Armstrong!  Can you come over to Mansfield's
office at three this afternoon?"
</p>

<p>
"You bet!  Any news?"
</p>

<p>
"Nope.  I'll have some by that time, though.  So long."
</p>

<p>
When Armstrong rejoined Dorothy before the train
exit, her eyes widened at sight of his radiant face.  She
seized his arm eagerly.
</p>

<p>
"Reese!  What is it?  Good news?"'
</p>

<p>
He smiled.  "Conference this afternoon with Dorns and
Mansfield."
</p>

<p>
"Now!  Aren't you ashamed of the way you've
worried?  Reese, there's something that has just occurred
to me.  You remember Muirhead, that Western man we
met at the Grays' on Christmas day&mdash;the one who was
telling about the Stockmen's Protective Association?  I
think that was the name of his cattle organization&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Armstrong nodded.  "Sure.  What about it?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, it suggested something to me!  Last night, you
were talking about forming some organization of the
stockholders to fight Macgowan.  Couldn't you give it that
very name&mdash;Stockholders' Protective Association?  It's a
splendid name!"
</p>

<p>
"Good!"  Armstrong's eyes kindled.  "Fine idea, Dot!
Sure, I'll take up the idea, and if Mansfield approves&mdash;but
here comes the crowd.  Train's in."
</p>

<p>
"Oh&mdash;there's father&mdash;Reese, don't you dare breathe a
word of trouble!"
</p>

<p>
The Demings joined them with hearty greetings.
J. Fortescue Deming clapped his son-in-law on the shoulder
admiringly.
</p>

<p>
"Reese, you're looking like a fighting-cock!  When Dot
left us so hurriedly, I had a notion you were in some sort
of a business fight.  Win out?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm winning!"  Armstrong laughed as the
words left his lips.  He knew suddenly that he was all right
again, that he was indeed winning.  After those few
words from Robert Dorns, ten minutes ago, the clouds had
lifted.
</p>

<p>
The faith of men still endured.
</p>

<p>
When he entered Mansfield's office, at three that
afternoon, Armstrong discovered that the lawyer had not been
idle these past few days.  Mansfield greeted him heartily;
Dorns had not yet arrived.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Mr. Armstrong, I have some definite word for
you.  That postal investigation is no longer to be feared."
</p>

<p>
"I never feared it."  Armstrong smiled.  "You have
blocked it, then?"'
</p>

<p>
The other assented.  "Yes, dependent upon my production
of certain evidence.  I have got this from Mr. Wren;
the rest is a matter of routine.  You've had no further
trouble?"
</p>

<p>
"None.  I've been awaiting word from you and have
kept quiet."
</p>

<p>
"Good.  Judge Holcomb should be here at any moment now."
</p>

<p>
"Holcomb?"  Armstrong's brows went up.  He had
not seen the judge since the latter had resigned from
Consolidated, and had fancied him out of town.
</p>

<p>
"He has been lending me some assistance in this affair,"
said Mansfield.  "Ah, here's Dorns now!  He seems to
bear tidings."
</p>

<p>
Robert Dorns appeared.  He came into the room,
stopped, regarded them with an expansive grin, and waved
his unlighted cigar.
</p>

<p>
"By glory, we got 'em!" he uttered.  "We got 'em cold!"'
</p>

<p>
Armstrong leaped to his feet.  "How?  Why?"
</p>

<p>
"Consolidated had a directors' meeting this morning.
Macgowan and Findlater got into the trough with both feet&mdash;back
salaries, fees, and so forth&mdash;they only touched the
treasury for about thirty-five thousand!  How does that
suit you, Q. Adams?"
</p>

<p>
During the amazed silence that greeted this information,
Judge Holcomb entered and was apprised of the news.
</p>

<p>
Dorns had reliable word of the directors' meeting from
one of his men now employed by Consolidated; his
guarantee of satisfactory evidence later on was more than
sufficient for his auditors.  Mansfield, quite aware of
Armstrong's leashed eagerness, interrupted the discussion.
</p>

<p>
"Gentlemen, one moment!  This audacity is astounding.
What do you think should be done, Mr. Armstrong?"
</p>

<p>
"We'll have to direct our fight at Findlater," said
Armstrong.  "Macgowan has left him in as president in order
to use him as a shield and figurehead.  The only way we
can hit at Macgowan is through Findlater.  Do you think
we can have him removed on the strength of this looting, or
both of them?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly&mdash;but not before April.  We must not conceal
from ourselves Macgowan's ability to use the law.  The
eyes of Justice are hooded, unfortunately, and we cannot
expect haste from the legal machinery."
</p>

<p>
"Then," said Armstrong, "I'll tell you what I propose
doing, and get your advice; it looks as though we must
make up our minds to a long fight.  First, we must take
all personalities out of the fight.  I want to figure in it as
little as possible.  There will be an understanding that I
am not fighting for any office in Consolidated; this fact
will serve tremendously in retaining for us the confidence
of the stockholders."
</p>

<p>
Holcomb and Mansfield nodded tacit assent.
</p>

<p>
"Now," went on Armstrong, "I don't want to climb on
any pedestal of altruistic virtue.  I suggest that we form
a Stockholders' Protective Association, composed of all
the Consolidated investors we can round up.  At the head
of this, place a committee of three men, of whom I suggest
Judge Holcomb as one.  The others may be selected later.
From now until the annual meeting on April third, let
this association carry on a campaign of publicity against
the Consolidated looters, particularly against Macgowan,
since he's the power behind Findlater.  Make clear that
this campaign is not directed against Consolidated, but for
Consolidated.
</p>

<p>
"While Mr. Mansfield is at work with Mr. Dorns, let us
reach every investor in the company through this association;
hold meetings, write letters, reach them by every
means!  Use the radio.  The Armstrong Company publishes
a monthly pamphlet for its <i>clientèle</i>, and this pamphlet
may be distributed to reach the entire list of investors&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"With what object?" interjected Judge Holcomb.
</p>

<p>
"That of obtaining their proxies for use at the annual
meeting."
</p>

<p>
This unexpected retort brought a new and frowning
attention to the eyes of his auditors.  He went on quickly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I've given up hope of a quick fight!  We'll not
down Macgowan in a hurry.  Judge, your thousand shares
of common are tied up in that voting trust, along with
mine; Macgowan is going to fight to keep that voting trust
from being dissolved a few days before the meeting, I'm
afraid.  We must take no chances.  I have some stock
outside the voting trust.  We must campaign for votes and
leave no effort unexpended.  We have something definite
to go on, now.  How much of that thirty-five thousand
was voted for back salaries, Dorns?"
</p>

<p>
The detective shook his head.  "No details yet.  Get
'em in a day or two."
</p>

<p>
"No matter," put in Mansfield, a gleam in his eye.
"Back salary in any amount is illegal."
</p>

<p>
"Exactly," went on Armstrong.  "That's my scheme,
gentlemen&mdash;publicity!  We have nothing to conceal; they
have everything.  I have written agreements from these
men to act without salary for three years, and the time
isn't up by a long shot.  We must count largely upon
Mr. Dorns to supply evidence from the books of Consolidated,
as we go along, in regard to what Macgowan does; but we
can obtain information without much trouble.
</p>

<p>
"I can prophesy one thing that'll be done soon.  Findlater
has a friend with some scheme for refining turpentine,
which I rejected as a wild dream.  The new directorate
will finance this scheme, mark me!  We shan't lack
ammunition.  The main thing is to reach every investor quickly,
giving him the truth about the new management and what
can be expected of it."
</p>

<p>
There was a moment of silence.  Judge Holcomb fingered
his gray beard frowningly.  Mansfield was gazing
reflectively at the ceiling.  Dorns chewed hard on a cigar.
The silence was at length broken by Holcomb.
</p>

<p>
"By gad, Armstrong, that plan is excellent!  You may
count on me to the limit.  Whom else shall we call in to
form this Protective Association?"
</p>

<p>
"Me," said Dorns.  The others looked at him.
</p>

<p>
"You?" said Armstrong.  "But you're not an investor&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Is that so, huh?"  Dorns held out his cigar and
grinned.  "I bought me five hundred shares of Consolidated
on Saturday!  I know a good thing when I see it,
or when somebody hits me over the head like you did last
Wednesday.  Yep, you count me in, see?"
</p>

<p>
"I suggest," said Mansfield in his quiet way, "that
Mr. Armstrong and Judge Holcomb take up this association
matter between them.  I shall at once apply for the
removal of Findlater and Macgowan, and shall confer
with you to-morrow, Mr. Armstrong, regarding the
extortion charge.  Judge, an excellent man to serve on your
committee would be Frederic Bruton, the president of
Baliol University&mdash;a man of the very highest character
and reputation, well known through the East, and if he
could be induced to serve&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"He can," put in Armstrong.  "He was one of my
professors at college.  I know him well, and shall run up
to Baliol the end of the week and see him."
</p>

<p>
"In that case, sir, you may make such use of my name
as you deem proper,"' said Mansfield unexpectedly.
</p>

<p>
Armstrong looked at these men&mdash;the burly detective, the
attorney, the retired financier and judge&mdash;and found
himself all at once wordless.  He remembered the wreck he had
been only a few days previously; yet now these men were
with him, supporting him not only with their effort and
money, but with their names and reputations.
</p>

<p>
"Gentlemen," he said abruptly, "I&mdash;I don't know how
to tell you how I appreciate your confidence in me&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He broke off abruptly as he had begun.
</p>

<p>
"Don't mention it, Armstrong&mdash;our confidence is in you
because you stand for something," said Judge Holcomb.
He added, a smile twisting at his lips: "I don't mind
saying, too, that Macgowan's law firm handed me a mean
jolt a year or two ago, and I haven't forgotten it by a good
deal!  Maybe I'm not altogether altruistic in this affair."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, hell!"  Dorns rose.  "Macgowan's a crook and we
know it.  So long, gentlemen!  See you again, Armstrong."
</p>

<p>
The conference had ended.  The fight had begun.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VI
</h3>

<p>
Dorothy's parents remained only a few days at
Aircastle Point, as their visit was no more than a
stop-off en route to Europe.  While it was not in
the nature of things that they should remain entirely
ignorant of Armstrong's business trouble, they were far
from comprehending its scope or gravity.  Armstrong
himself defined it to Deming as "a general shake-up," and
no more was said on the subject.
</p>

<p>
On the last evening of their stay, Mrs. Deming confided
a secretly cherished ambition to Dorothy.  This was at the
dinner table.
</p>

<p>
"You know, dear, when your father and I used to come
to New York, we always went to the Waldorf.  I'd like to
go there again&mdash;couldn't we take luncheon there
to-morrow?"
</p>

<p>
Dorothy turned eagerly to her father.  He smiled and
shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"I'm lunching with Reese and a friend of his to-morrow;
sorry!  We go aboard at four, you know.  Can we change
it, Reese?"
</p>

<p>
"Not very well," said Armstrong.  "Judge Holcomb
wants us at the Phi Gam club&mdash;it's a birthday luncheon
in his honor.  Suppose we get away early and meet you at
the Waldorf?  You can lunch there, and we'll spend an
hour with you looking over old ground and reviving
honeymoon recollections.  That right, J. Fortescue?"
</p>

<p>
"Honeymoon is correct."  Deming laughed.  "Mother
has a positive affection for the Waldorf&mdash;eh, my dear?
Will the program suit you?"
</p>

<p>
Thus it happened, on the following day, that Dorothy
and Mrs. Deming entered the Waldorf together about one
o'clock.  Scarcely were they inside, when a pleasurably
astonished voice greeted them with eager delight.
</p>

<p>
"Why&mdash;Mrs. Deming!  Dorothy!  This is a joyful
encounter sure enough!"
</p>

<p>
It was Pete Slosson.
</p>

<p>
"You-all must lunch with me&mdash;please!" he went on
quickly.  "I'm lonely; don't know a soul around here&mdash;and
then you turn up!  Will you befriend a stranger?
Please!"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Deming, who had always rather liked Slosson, was
quick to accept, and Dorothy had no reason to decline.
True, Slosson was associated in business with Ried
Williams, and since that country club dance she had felt
detestation and even hatred for Williams; but, in her eyes,
Slosson had ever been no more than an impulsive boy, too
abundantly endowed with youth and vitality for his own
good.
</p>

<p>
Slosson secured a window table.  Dorothy sat with her
back to the room, before her all the passing pomp and
glitter of the Avenue, while Mrs. Deming chose to enjoy
the dining-room itself.  Their host was obviously on his
best behavior.  Usually there was in Slosson's bearing a
good deal of self-consciousness; he liked to pose a little.
To-day, the meeting was so unexpected that he revealed
himself sincerely enough.
</p>

<p>
Dorothy was rather glad of the meeting.  She had known
Pete Slosson all her life.  In the way of women, she saw
him not as men saw the real Pete Slosson.  She saw only
the better part of him, lying far underneath the surface&mdash;the
man of dreams and might-have been.
</p>

<p>
Once she had even fancied herself in love with him.
Dorothy could not forget this; she did not have it to
forgive, since Slosson had never known it.  Because he
had been genuinely in love with her, she held him in some
measure of friendship and sympathetic regard.
</p>

<p>
"I'm glad you're doing so well in Indianapolis, Pete,"
she said frankly.  "Are you often in New York?"
</p>

<p>
"No, unless something special comes up.  I got in last
night, and am leaving again to-night&mdash;I've no time for
frivolity any more.  When I come, it's on business that
demands quick action."
</p>

<p>
"You're certainly looking in fine shape!"  Dorothy
regarded him with a smile.  "You seem a lot more human,
Pete!"
</p>

<p>
Slosson colored a little.  "Well, I've come more in
contact with people, for a fact," he said awkwardly.  "It's
hard to explain&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"No, it isn't!" she countered.  "You're in constructive
business, Pete.  Happiness always comes to the builder,
don't you think?  Only a positive and constructive person
can perceive the real good in things and people&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She checked herself abruptly, conscious that some one
had come to a stop almost behind her chair.  She saw
Slosson glance up and change countenance.  Then a
genially maudlin voice broke in upon her&mdash;a voice whose
liquor-tinged accents sent a shiver through her whole body.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo, Slosson!  In town and throwing a party, eh?
By gad, old man&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Dorothy turned her head.  Her inquiring gaze met the
eyes of Macgowan.  His words died out, and for an
instance there was dead silence.
</p>

<p>
Macgowan was sobered by his incredible and ghastly
error.  For once his glib tongue was daunted; under
Dorothy's gaze, a slow, deep flush crept into his cheeks.
Sweat started upon his brow.  Dorothy regarded him
calmly, without apparent recognition.
</p>

<p>
"Why, it's Mr. Macgowan!" exclaimed Mrs. Deming.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," echoed Dorothy, still gazing at him.  "Yes, it's
Mr. Macgowan, the liar and traitor, the Judas who betrayed
his friend.  He seems to have been celebrating his
treachery, to judge from his voice.  I suppose we should
diagnose his ailment as spiritual leprosy.  Be careful
you're not infected, Pete!  I'd be sorry to think of you
as being in the same class with this man."
</p>

<p>
She calmly turned her back on Macgowan.  The effect
of her impersonal arraignment was frightful.  A mortal
pallor in his face, Macgowan managed a slight, stiff bow,
turned, and went his way.  Under the circumstances, that
bow was more than a parting gesture; it was an
achievement.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Deming was staring at her daughter with horrified
eyes.
</p>

<p>
"My dear!  You simply can't realize what you're
saying&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense, mother.  This man Macgowan has tried his
best to ruin and disgrace Reese, betraying all the trust that
was placed in him.  He can't do it, but he has made
trouble.  Now, don't worry!  I know what I'm saying,
and I'm glad I had the chance to say it to his face.  After
this, he won't be quite so free and easy when he sees his
friends dining in public.  He made a mistake to-day that
he'll remember&mdash;drunk or sober!"
</p>

<p>
"See here, Dot!" exclaimed Slosson hurriedly, almost
too hurriedly.  "Don't call him a friend of mine!  I
hardly know the man; haven't seen him since your
wedding!"'
</p>

<p>
Dorothy, instantly contrite, reached out and quickly
patted his hand.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't mean to be catty, Pete; honest!  If I had
thought you and he were friends, I'd not be sitting here
with you, be sure of that!  And mother, please stop looking
so disconcerted!  Macgowan has passed out of our lives,
that's all."'
</p>

<p>
Slosson drew a quick breath, gazed at her admiringly.
</p>

<p>
"By the lord, Dot, you sure handed it to him!  And the
look on his face when he saw you!  Well, I don't know the
circumstances, but I should say that no matter what he did
to Reese, you've repaid a good share of it to-day!"
</p>

<p>
Dorothy smiled.  "I tried to.  Mother, please don't say
anything about this to Reese."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Deming sighed and assented, her eyes troubled.
</p>

<p>
"Very well, dear.  I'm dreadfully sorry to learn about
this.  I can realize, too, how you and Reese must feel.
Your poor father felt the same way when he found Food
Products wrecked and lost to him."
</p>

<p>
Dorothy turned pale.  Slosson fumbled with his cigarette
case.  Mrs. Deming, quite unconscious of the effect
produced by her perfectly casual words, sipped her tea.
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean, mother?" asked Dorothy in a
strained voice.  "You don't mean that&mdash;that any one was
to blame for father's losing the company?  Why, I thought
he was so delighted over the way Reese handled it!"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Deming quickly assented.
</p>

<p>
"So he was, child, of course!  No, no one was to
blame&mdash;and your father never let anybody dream that he was
hurt.  But I could see how he felt it.  Now, we must not
talk about such things any more.  Let's everybody be
bright and pleasant!  This is our last day in the United
States&mdash;and I'm sure we'll be miserable enough in Europe
without borrowing trouble here.  I just know the house
will be in dreadful shape when we get home!"
</p>

<p>
Dorothy glanced at Slosson, who was lighting a cigarette.
For a moment his eyes met hers, and in them she read a
startled uneasiness.  It frightened her.  So did his words,
despite the smile upon his lips.
</p>

<p>
"That's right, Mrs. Deming&mdash;never mind what's past
and gone!  Let the dead bury their dead, eh?  Only stirs
up trouble and does no good, to rake over the past."
</p>

<p>
Dorothy glance at her watch.  "Mercy!  We must meet
father and Reese&mdash;come along, Pete!  They'll be delighted
to see you.  We're to meet them in the parlors&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"For a moment only."  Slosson rose.  "I'm overdue
now for an appointment, Dot.  I'll come along and shake
hands, then duck."
</p>

<p>
It did not occur to Dorothy to ask with whom he had an
appointment.  And Slosson certainly had no intention of
volunteering that it was with Lawrence Macgowan.
</p>

<p>
As a matter of fact, Dorothy could think only of one
thing&mdash;those words, so terrible because so innocent, which
her mother had uttered.  With this, the air and speech
of Slosson, as though he too knew some dread secret in
regard to Food Products and the manner in which it had
changed hands.
</p>

<p>
She had seized the opportunity afforded her by Macgowan
with an avid, fierce exultancy.  Now this was all
fled.  Upon her spirit settled the old haunting terror, with
the clear-cut vividness of some horrible dream.  Was the
thing possible, after all?  Could there have been any
truth in those malicious words of Macgowan, the day of
the wedding?
</p>

<p>
Here at last she had definite knowledge of how her
father had regarded his practical expulsion from Food
Products.  Now, as she met her father and Armstrong, as
Slosson made his greetings and farewells, she was scarcely
conscious of what passed; her eyes went from her father
to her husband, searching and probing.  What was it that
Slosson knew?  What was there that she did not know,
about that change of management?
</p>

<p>
Or was it all imagination?  Now, as that night in Evansville,
she found herself fighting doubt with doubt, distrust
with distrust.  Here in the hotel, on the way to the
steamer, in the stateroom itself&mdash;again and again she was
impelled to speak out, to utter everything, to force a
complete understanding.  Yet she dared not.  What had
she to utter?  Suspicion.  Suspicion&mdash;of her husband!
It was unthinkable.  Each time the temptation came,
pride and love&mdash;love most of all&mdash;exorcised the thought.
In her father's face she read the lines of hidden hurt; or
was it all her own fancy?  Tormented, doubtful of herself,
she held her peace.
</p>

<p>
And now that other fear returned upon her, the fear
upspringing from knowledge of the life beneath her heart.
Was it possible that she was allowing some unnatural
obsession to prey on her mind?  She dreaded this possibility,
dreaded it unspeakably!  And now, as before, she
struggled against it all, fought desperately with heart and
soul and mind against it.
</p>

<p>
When she and Reese had waved the last adieu and were
being driven back through the city, Armstrong talked of
things that had occurred that morning.  He was enthused,
beaming, radiating energy and confidence.
</p>

<p>
"Your Stockholders' Protective Association is now a
fact, lady!" he declared happily.  "Judge Holcomb is to
head the committee of three; we've written President
Bruton of Baliol and I'm to run up there to-morrow and
see him, and if possible secure him for second place.  And
for the third man, whom do you think we've secured?
Rupert Sessions!"
</p>

<p>
"What!"  Dorothy was startled out of her troubled
train of thought.  "Sessions&mdash;the lecturer and novelist?
The man who wrote all those business novels?  Why, he
lectured in Evansville just before we were married!"
</p>

<p>
"The same!"  Armstrong laughed in delight.  "Some
one found that he was a stockholder and lived just outside
town.  We had him up at the office this morning, laid
everything before him; he's with us.  And to-morrow we
file suit on behalf of the Association&mdash;suit for one million
dollars against Macgowan and Findlater, on the grounds
of conspiracy, and demand their removal.  Things are
looking up, I tell you!"
</p>

<p>
Dorothy stared through the car window, her brain
riotous.  With such men as Rupert Sessions, Dorns,
Holcomb, Bruton, behind this husband of hers, nationally
known figures, backing him with their faith and high
repute and money&mdash;was she to entertain such vague and
shadowy doubts, such petty and base doubts, of him?
</p>

<p>
"It's a wonderful thing, lady!"  His voice reached her,
now more restrained and thoughtful.  "The Association
is the only thing now between Macgowan and his loot; it's
not me they're behind, however.  We're not fighting for
ourselves, at heart&mdash;though we're not prating about our
altruism, naturally.  It's for the sixteen thousand
investors, the people scattered up and down the
country&mdash;the fishes in Macgowan's net!"
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" said Dorothy suddenly.  "But it's a fight of
sixteen thousand and one, Reese&mdash;with the one man at the
head of it who's worth it all!"
</p>

<p>
This thought dominated her, filled her with ecstasy,
banished her shadows.  And so, with wonder and love and
admiration for the man she called husband, to aid her, she
won her fight for faith.
</p>

<p>
Yet this fight had been harder to win than the first
battle, back in Evansville.

<h3>
CHAPTER VII
</h3>

<p>
February drew on apace, arrived, began to spend
its length.
</p>

<p>
Armstrong was healthily busy, up to his ears in
work; with each day the fight proved more drawn-out.
The campaign against Findlater and Macgowan swept
along steadily.  The financial press was full of it, even
the newspapers were airing the affair; and Macgowan,
beyond flat denials of all the charges, was keeping quiet.
</p>

<p>
His quiet was ominous.
</p>

<p>
The Armstrong Company was now completely reorganized
as a financial service corporation, restricted to New
York and seaboard cities.  For the moment, Armstrong
was forced to forget Macgowan and give his energies to
putting the Armstrong Company on its feet, able to get
along under Wren's management.  As soon as counter
blows began to smash home he would have to sweep aside
all else; so, for the present, he worked over the Armstrong
Company, flinging himself into it with driving energy.
In one of its offices was domiciled the Stockholders'
Protective Association, under its committee of three.
</p>

<p>
With every day that passed, Armstrong found himself
more impressed with Mansfield's advice as to this
committee.  Judge Holcomb had entered the fight with the
ardor of a boy; a jurist of the highest integrity, a financier
intimately associated with men in high places, he was
invaluable.  So, too, was Bruton&mdash;a man whom Macgowan
could not possibly attack on any grounds.  As for Rupert
Sessions, a fiery but scholarly publicist and
lecturer&mdash;Armstrong could not but feel sufficiently grateful for the
chance which had flung such a man to his support.
</p>

<p>
Sessions had outlined a campaign for the month of
March which would reach every investor.  His broadside
letters were already causing a sensation.  It was as a direct
result of one of these letters, that Armstrong was one
afternoon hastily summoned to a conference with the committee.
He found them gravely discussing a telegram which had
just arrived from Mansfield in Albany.
</p>

<p>
"Armstrong," said Judge Holcomb, with a grim smile,
"you recall that last letter Session sent out?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."  Armstrong chuckled at the memory.  "About
the National Reduction Company which Consolidated has
undertaken to finance.  You certainly called a spade a
spade, Sessions!  And right, too; this private graft of
Findlater's is bound to be a failure, so far as the
stockholders are concerned."
</p>

<p>
"Findlater will file suit to-morrow for a hundred
thousand in damages, also asking punitive damages.
Libel."
</p>

<p>
Armstrong grunted sarcastically.
</p>

<p>
"Let him file!  It's all he can do to save his face, judge.
I'll guarantee to pay all the damages he'll ever collect,
too."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, the suit will never go to trial."  Sessions took up
a telegram.  "But see here, Armstrong!  This is what we
called you in for.  We'll have bad news to send out next
week."
</p>

<p>
Armstrong took the message and read it.
</p>

<p>
The attorney general of the state had refused to institute
suit for removal of Findlater and Macgowan.  At the
hearing, a certain lawyer famed for his political affiliations&mdash;not
named in the telegram&mdash;had obtained the dismissal
of the action, on the technical ground that Consolidated
Securities had been organized under the laws of South
Dakota; and therefore being a foreign corporation, was not
amenable to the New York jurisdiction.
</p>

<p>
"Check," said Armstrong quietly, giving no sign of his
disappointment.  "Well, we were warned that we were
up against politics!  You can make capital of this,
Sessions.  The dismissal is purely technical and does not
clear Macgowan.  This simply saves them from producing
the books&mdash;play up their refusal to stand investigation!
They're not vindicated by this; they're merely
relieved."
</p>

<p>
While still speaking, he was summoned to the telephone.
He sat down at a desk near by.
</p>

<p>
"Armstrong?  Robert Dorns on the wire.  Say,
Findlater and Macgowan have quarreled; it don't amount to
much, but it's a symptom.  Do you know a fellow over
there named Henderson?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Assistant treasurer of Consolidated.  A good
man, too.  What about him?"
</p>

<p>
"I think he'd like to quit his job.  Suppose we make
him an offer if he'll quit and bring his copies of
records&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"See here, Dorns, none of that!" snapped Armstrong
angrily, while the committee eyed him in startled wonder.
"I'll not pay out one cent of bribery for anything&mdash;and I
don't think Henderson is the sort who'd take a bribe.  Did
he suggest that?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  I thought it up all by my own little self, me lad.
S'pose we pry him loose?"
</p>

<p>
"All right.  In that case, I can use him here.  He can
give us more inside dope on Consolidated's doings than
any one else.  But not a cent for bribery, understand!  If
Henderson would take any money for coming over here,
I'd not have him and I'd not trust him.  We just had
word from Mansfield.  The suit is dismissed on technical
grounds."
</p>

<p>
"Political, you mean.  All right.  So long."
</p>

<p>
Armstrong swung around to meet the intent gaze of
Judge Holcomb.
</p>

<p>
"Henderson is leaving Consolidated?"
</p>

<p>
"Dorns thinks he can be persuaded to leave."
</p>

<p>
"Then things are coming well.  Henderson can give us
all the details we need.  Well, when do you look for an
attack from Macgowan?"
</p>

<p>
"When we least expect it."
</p>

<p>
The attack came soon enough, with a savage disregard
for truth.  Macgowan, indeed, had perforce to disregard
truth if he were to make any attack.
</p>

<p>
As secretary and treasurer, Macgowan was the real head
of Consolidated Securities.  This was a crafty move, for
it outwardly relegated Macgowan to the background and
left Findlater to enjoy his prominence as president&mdash;and
also to bear the brunt of attack from the Protective
Association.
</p>

<p>
This arrangement had other uses, also.  Macgowan's
law firm or firms, for he was interested in more than one,
could profit largely, while Macgowan himself drew a
thousand a month for his personal services.  Thus the
cream of the loot fell to Macgowan.  Findlater, although
recompensing himself in full, had at least some idea of
retaining Consolidated as a going concern.  Macgowan, more
shrewd and crafty, knew better&mdash;knew that some day his
joy-ride must come to an end.  Findlater did not take in
just how far he was serving as a tool in the cunning hand
of his associate.
</p>

<p>
He was only too well aware, however, of Macgowan's
dictatorial manner, and resented it.
</p>

<p>
Thus, when the attack on Armstrong and the Protective
Association was opened, the guns were fired by Findlater,
as president of Consolidated.  A full broadside was
delivered; a broadside of calumny which even extended to
Doctor Bruton and Rupert Sessions, but which was aimed
at Armstrong.  By the very audacity of its charges and
vilifications it was calculated to stagger its recipients.  It
came in the form of a <i>Consolidated Magazine</i>, sent out
to investors generally as a reply to the <i>Armstrong
Review</i> the house organ of the Armstrong Company,
which was at present being used by the Association
committee.
</p>

<p>
Macgowan had employed writers of some talent, and
under cover of Findlater's name he went the limit.
Adopting a tone of dignified censure, the president set
forth that the Armstrong Company had been "discharged"
as the fiscal agent of Consolidated; he gave copies of the
affidavits which had "caused" the postal investigation; he
charged that Armstrong and his hirelings were now
attacking Consolidated for the purpose of getting at its
funds.  In effect, the charges made by Armstrong were
simply turned back on him, yet with no more evidence than
truth.
</p>

<p>
The result was well calculated, however, to impress the
small investor.  Covert attacks were made upon the
integrity of the Association committee.  A special article,
venomously penned, purported to set forth Armstrong's
biography&mdash;a combination of actual untruths and of
innuendoes which made Armstrong first laugh, then whiten
with fury.
</p>

<p>
He laid the matter before Mansfield, who glanced
through the articles and then smiled.
</p>

<p>
"Well?  I suppose we'll file libel suits immediately?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course," said Armstrong.  "But more&mdash;get an
injunction against Findlater at once, to prevent his using
this magazine to serve his own ends.  It bears the name
of Consolidated and is company property.  Also, prevent
his using company funds for the same purpose.  If he is
going to present his personal affairs to the investors, let
him pay for it himself!"
</p>

<p>
"Good!" exclaimed Mansfield.  "A good point!  We'll
do it; he can't keep us from getting that injunction.  This
publication appears to be a tissue of falsehood, too."
</p>

<p>
"It is, from start to finish."
</p>

<p>
"Congratulations, Mr. Armstrong!  We have them
badly scared, or they would never go to such lengths.  This
libelous matter is astounding!"
</p>

<p>
"It shows that we've scared them, all right," assented
Armstrong.  "Also, it shows that Macgowan is trying to
discredit me and is going after proxies for the annual
meeting.  Mansfield, isn't there any earthly way of
smashing that voting trust?"
</p>

<p>
The lawyer shook his head.  "No.  And I am afraid
that, as we feared, Macgowan will find some way of postponing
its expiration until after the meeting.  That would
enable him to remain in power for another year, of course."
</p>

<p>
Armstrong's lips contracted for an instant.
</p>

<p>
"Then we must get enough investors behind us to override
his control.  We'll do it.  We have two thousand of
them now enrolled in the Association, and our real
campaign doesn't open until March&mdash;another week yet.
You've filed suit against 'em in South Dakota?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Your own company is organized under the laws
of that state, I believe?"
</p>

<p>
"It is; they were both organized at the same time.  By
the way, there's something I want to ask you about&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Armstrong had not forgotten the information which
Jimmy Wren had laid before him, that day when Wren
turned up in Evansville.  He now told Mansfield how the
Deming Food Products Company had been taken over and
reorganized.  He went on to relate Wren's discovery&mdash;that
Deming's directors, probably without Deming's
knowledge, had sworn to a false financial condition in
obtaining licenses to market their stock issue.
</p>

<p>
"Can Macgowan rake that up against us in any possible
way?" he concluded.  "At the time the licenses were
issued, we had nothing to do with Food Products, you
know."
</p>

<p>
"No; you're entirely safe there, I think," promptly
declared Mansfield.  "Don't let it worry you for a
minute&mdash;it has nothing whatever to do with you."
</p>

<p>
There was something else, however, which in the rush of
business Armstrong had quite forgotten.  Upon the
following Monday, the last Monday in February, he was
reminded of his delinquency in abrupt and terrible
fashion.
</p>

<p>
By this time the fight between Findlater and the
Protective Association was not only public property but was
being keenly followed by banking circles and kindred
interests.  Among all these there was a cynically lucid
understanding of the real issue; it was no secret to them
that the struggle lay between looters and honest men.  Yet
they looked on with a phlegmatic acuity; it was to them
only another battle wherein the dreamer would probably
lose to the clever fighter who knew how to hit foul and
hard.
</p>

<p>
Armstrong knew this.  He felt that he knew exactly how
to appraise the spoken word from his bankers, his friends,
his acquaintances.  In this he was wrong; he was still too
conscious of himself and his campaign, and it tended to
give him a false view.  A man is at his best only when he
can forget himself.  His best work is done only when his
"office clothes" are forgotten.
</p>

<p>
On this eventful Monday, Armstrong was taken
unawares, in a moment of self-consciousness.
</p>

<p>
He took the day off, for it was his birthday, and spent
it quietly at home with Dorothy before going into the city
in the evening for <i>Lohengrin</i>.  Before a blazing log fire
in the wide hearth of the living room that afternoon, he
was recounting to Dorothy the prospects for the final few
weeks of the campaign; he had given up hope of ousting
Findlater and Macgowan before the annual meeting.
Then, in the gathering dusk, a caller arrived, a stranger.
Armstrong had the man shown in.
</p>

<p>
He found himself promptly served with a sheriff's
attachment notice.  Suit for two millions in damages&mdash;a new
suit&mdash;had been filed against the Armstrong Company by
Findlater, on trumped-up charges of fraud, deceit, slander.
Almost at the same moment he was summoned to the telephone,
to hear the furious voice of Wren.  The offices, bank
accounts, mail receipts, files&mdash;all were tied up by the
attachment.
</p>

<p>
Further, unless Armstrong's note for ten thousand
dollars, held by Consolidated, were paid in cash by noon
of the following day, the security for that note would be
sold, promptly at noon, at the weekly auction sales in
Vesey Street.
</p>

<p>
Then Armstrong remembered the thing he had forgotten&mdash;the
renewal of this loan, which had come due.  Food
Products had not been heard from in regard to it.
</p>

<p>
"Get in touch with Mansfield at once," he told Jimmy
Wren.  "The suit is only an excuse to tie us up so we
can't get the cash to meet this note.  They got the
attachment because we're a foreign corporation, and Mansfield
will get it released in a day or two.  You attend to that.
I'm going to have my hands full raising ten thousand
in cash."
</p>

<p>
He made light of it to Dorothy, assuaged her alarm
and indignation, pointed out the utter absurdity of the
charges, and packed her off to dress for dinner and opera.
But he remained staring into the fire, his face set in drawn
lines.
</p>

<p>
Crafty Macgowan!  This blow had driven home.  The
morning papers, hungry for news from this financial battle,
would headline the filing of this suit.
</p>

<p>
With everything tied up by the attachment, it was
impossible for Armstrong to raise the money necessary to
meet that note.  But that was not the worst of it.
Macgowan did not want the ten thousand in cash; he had filed
this suit, had played his cards, so that Armstrong could
not possibly pay the money.  What Macgowan wanted was
the security, the Food Products notes for twenty-five
thousand dollars!  That was the stake Macgowan would
win at noon to-morrow.
</p>

<p>
"He'll have his fingers hooked into Food Products,"
thought Armstrong bitterly.  "He may try to throw the
company into receivership&mdash;no telling what he'll do!  And
unless I show up at the auction rooms by noon, he wins."
</p>

<p>
How to get that money?  His imagination pictured
what would meet him as he went from bank to bank, asking
for ten thousand in cash&mdash;without security!  Macgowan
would see to it that news of this suit and attachment filled
all the morning papers.  Everywhere he went, Armstrong
would be faced by that news.
</p>

<p>
He would be charged publicly with fraud, branded in all
eyes as a perjurer and trickster; the whole financial
district would be ringing with the news.  No matter how
baseless the charge, it would clang against him like a
death-knell.  It would be dismissed soon enough, after serving its
purpose; even so, lies have nine lives, and the story of the
charge would go further than news of the dismissal.
</p>

<p>
"I've got to do everything between ten and twelve
to-morrow," said Armstrong, turning from the fire.  "I
expect I'll find mighty few friends anxious to be
interviewed to-morrow morning&mdash;it takes small noise to flush
the bird of credit.  Well, I'll go down fighting!"
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap0208"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII
</h3>

<p>
Armstrong entered his own office a little after
nine in the morning, crushing a newspaper in his
hand; what he had read there had rendered him
livid with helpless anger.  He found Jimmy Wren
awaiting him.
</p>

<p>
"Hello!" exclaimed Wren.  "I saw Mansfield last
night.  He said that he'd attend to releasing this
attachment by this afternoon anyhow.  There's a check from
Food Products in the mail, but we can't use it; everything
tied up."
</p>

<p>
Armstrong only nodded, and handed Wren a penciled
list of names.
</p>

<p>
"Call up these fellows, Jimmy, or their secretaries, and
make appointments for me between ten and twelve this
morning.  Spread the appointments as well as you can.
If I don't raise that ten thousand&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"As bad as that, is it?"' asked Jimmy Wren, his eyes
anxious.  "You're borrowing?"
</p>

<p>
"How the devil can I get it without?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I sort of figured on that last night."  Jimmy
Wren came to the desk, and began to disgorge bills from
his pockets.  He looked up at the astounded Armstrong
with a grin.  "I'm darned sorry I couldn't do better,
Reese.  Here's twelve hundred to throw into the pot,
anyhow."
</p>

<p>
For an instant Armstrong was speechless.  Then:
</p>

<p>
"By gad, Jimmy!  You can't mean&mdash;where did you get
this cash?"
</p>

<p>
Wren colored slightly.
</p>

<p>
"I had some in my sock, and I borrowed the rest&mdash;from
a friend.  Now, get it tied up and I'll go sit over the
telephone.  I'll have a taxi here.  You cool off and we'll
make the rounds together."
</p>

<p>
Jimmy departed hastily, leaving Armstrong staring at
the pile of bills.  Jimmy Wren the impulsive, the
warm-hearted, the devoted!
</p>

<p>
At one minute of twelve, Armstrong reached the auction
rooms in Vesey Street.  When he entered, the Food
Products notes were being offered for sale.  Armstrong
handed over ten thousand in cash for them.
</p>

<p>
How he had collected that money, he scarcely knew; he
knew, however, that he had in his thoughts wronged his
friends.  That two-million-dollar suit had rung like a
bugle-blast across the pages of the morning papers, yet
his friends had rallied.  He had seen man after man,
stating his case briefly, setting his simple word against all
the thunderous allegations of the enemy&mdash;and he had won.
</p>

<p>
The moment his victory was assured, he came near going
to pieces.  For two hours he had been under a tremendous
strain, pouring forth every atom of his energy and will-power;
now he was shaken, broken by the effort, exhausted.
He knew that Findlater was somewhere here, and
Macgowan, but he ignored them.  He got away as quickly as
possible, in the taxicab that Jimmy had hired.
</p>

<p>
Of what took place during the remainder of that day, he
was scarcely conscious.  The blow had been warded,
however.  And, in the afternoon, he had Mansfield's grim
assurance that the suit would never come into court, that
the attachment was released.
</p>

<p>
As though that victory turned the tide of affairs, the
succeeding days witnessed a steady ebb in the fortunes of
Findlater and Macgowan, a corresponding flood in the
prospects of the Protective Association.  Mansfield was
hammering away energetically.  He obtained an
injunction which cut short Findlater's campaign with the
money and property of Consolidated; this forced the enemy
to spend actual money of his own, and was a shrewd blow.
</p>

<p>
The annual meeting of the stockholders of Consolidated
was called, and the place named was Wilmington.  Upon
this fact Sessions seized with avidity.  He flooded the
mails with letters, pointing out that Findlater was afraid
to hold the meeting under the jurisdiction of South Dakota
courts, pointing out that Wilmington was not readily
accessible to many of the investors, driving home new
charges of trickery and fraud.
</p>

<p>
Now the fight was becoming serious for Macgowan, and
the latter knew it.  Thousands of the investors were
registered with the Association, proxies were pouring in,
and the denials and camouflage used by the Consolidated
directors availed little.  Findlater was himself carrying on
a desperate battle for proxies, under the guidance of
Macgowan, and neglected nothing in the effort to avert disaster.
Armstrong wondered how the two of them would get out
from under the swelling tide of libel and perjury which
they were creating.
</p>

<p>
Then the campaign rose to a smashing climax&mdash;all that
Armstrong could have desired.
</p>

<p>
Into Armstrong's office, late one afternoon, walked
Henderson, the assistant treasurer of Consolidated
Securities.  He looked at Armstrong with a wry smile.
</p>

<p>
"I want to get into this Protective Association and turn
over my voting proxy to you," he said quietly.  "And if
there's any information I can furnish, just ask."
</p>

<p>
"What's the answer?" demanded Armstrong curtly.
He knew Henderson was square, yet&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I've resigned." Henderson read his thought.  "Things
are getting too rotten over there to suit me.  If you can
use me in your company, I'd like a job&mdash;but I'm not
offering you information to get it.  My ten shares of stock
look pretty big to me, and if the Association doesn't win
this fight they're going to look pretty small.  Job or no,
I'm with you."
</p>

<p>
"That's straight talk," said Armstrong.  "Come over
and see Judge Holcomb."
</p>

<p>
Within an hour the Association was in possession of
affidavits from Henderson which went into type and print
the following day.  At last the inside operation of
Consolidated, under Findlater's management, was exposed to
public scrutiny.  To sum up Henderson's information:
</p>

<p>
1.  The National Reduction Company, Findlater's pet
scheme, had been put through just as proposed to
Armstrong, with large free gifts of stock to Consolidated
directors, and had to date cost the stockholders of
Consolidated something over a hundred thousand.
</p>

<p>
2.  Further, Macgowan was purchasing all the preferred
stock of Consolidated that he could secure around seventy,
using company funds paid out on company checks.  This
stock was being resold to new investors at nearly double
that price.  About a thousand shares per week were
changing hands in this fashion, and on each share
Macgowan and Findlater received ten dollars commission as
private loot.
</p>

<p>
3.  The back salaries given Macgowan and the other
looters were confirmed.  Henderson also swore to a statement
regarding the financial solvency of Consolidated&mdash;a
statement showing that the value of Consolidated stock was
dropping with alarming rapidity.
</p>

<p>
With these affidavits, the Protective Association swept
into action.  Burton, Sessions and Holcomb took the stump,
addressing meetings wherever two or three investors could
be gathered together.  They blew away the dust from
Macgowan's tracks, centered the entire battle upon the
management of Findlater and his associates, appealed to
the investors to alter this management at the forthcoming
annual meeting.
</p>

<p>
Dorns armed them well with photographic copies from
Consolidated's books and with letters written or received
by Findlater.  Henderson's affidavits fortified them with
startling facts.  And all the while the <i>Armstrong Review</i>
hammered away, reaching each individual investor,
backing up everything with the printed word.
</p>

<p>
Nor did the committee end here.  To the stockholders
they presented a constructive program, with guarantees
that the proxies would be used to put it into effect.  The
chief points of this program were the removal of the
present management, a strict investigation of the company's
affairs, and an enforced accounting for misused funds.
Through all these weeks of campaigning swept the battle-cry
of "Show the books!"&mdash;a cry to which Findlater
turned a deaf ear.  Neither he nor Macgowan were
insensible to the danger that threatened them, however.
</p>

<p>
They darted forth sudden and vicious attacks in a desperate
effort so to discredit Armstrong and his associates
that the investors would withhold proxies from them.
The hand that launched these attacks was that of Findlater,
but the brain behind them all was that of Macgowan, bitter
and virulent.  In half a dozen states Macgowan was
seeking to obtain indictments against Armstrong on any sort
of charge&mdash;but Armstrong, too, was fighting.  Dorns and
his men were vigilant, Mansfield was quick to parry and
strike back.  So transparent were the artifices of
Macgowan that Armstrong was almost lulled into a feeling of
security.
</p>

<p>
The tide steadily set in favor of the Protective Association.
The body of stockholders were whipped into a
frantic condition; suit and counter-suit, charge and
counter-charge, all contributed to lash them into wild alarm.
Upon some the crafty wiles of Macgowan prevailed; his
campaign for proxies was reaching a desperate climax.
The majority, however, came to realize the actual facts, and
the magic of Armstrong's name and personality was not
lost.  For, despite the most incredible efforts, Macgowan
was unable to discredit this man who had been his friend.
One would have said that every move of Macgowan's was
blocked by some invisible hand, or was brought to fruitless
issue by some unseen agent.
</p>

<p>
By the final week in March, the campaign ended.  Weary,
still athrill with the fight they had waged, the committee of
three returned to the city, ready for the meeting at
Wilmington.  Armstrong had remained in charge of the home
offices, attending to the vast detail work that was necessary.
Now, when he came to check up with his associates, they
found cause for exultation indeed.
</p>

<p>
"Nearly all the outstanding shares," said Judge Holcomb,
as they went over the lists, "are owned in lots of
one or two.  So far, we seem to be in control of a good ten
thousand votes&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"And more coming in with every mail," put in Sessions.
"Besides what we've bought up in the open market.  How
does she stand, Armstrong?"
</p>

<p>
"A total of thirty-five thousand outstanding," said
Armstrong, who knew the figures by heart.  "At this minute
we own or control twenty thousand."
</p>

<p>
There was a moment of silence.  Then Mansfield, who
was present, intervened to cut short the jubilant
expressions of victory.
</p>

<p>
"Including those in the voting trust?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Three thousand there."
</p>

<p>
"Suppose we defer celebrations," said Judge Holcomb
shrewdly.  "Everything's going to change before the
meeting; it's bound to.  If I were you, I'd look for a last
minute blow from those rascals.  Therefore, go slow&mdash;and
don't let up!"
</p>

<p>
This was good advice.  Armstrong realized that,
notwithstanding the apparent victory, both his personal credit
and that of the Armstrong Company had suffered an
extraordinary amount of damage, not to mention the harm
that this fight was causing Consolidated as a business
concern.  The damage would be assessed at law, but it was
done.
</p>

<p>
That Macgowan had met with some success in his campaign
for proxies, was evident.  His methods had been to
utilize falsehood, brazen filing of suits which would never
be tried, desperate attempts to publicize Armstrong as a
trickster and cheat.  Yet with all this, the control of
Consolidated was bound to pass to Armstrong at the annual
meeting.  His three thousand shares tied up in the voting
trust would, when released, confirm the victory.
</p>

<p>
But Judge Holcomb, keen old veteran that he was, had
prophesied truly.
</p>

<p>
Six days before the annual meeting, the blow fell.  Macgowan
came into the open as plaintiff, filing suit upon
absolutely baseless charges which, however, served as grounds
for making an attachment.  Upon the voting
trustees&mdash;Macgowan, Findlater and Jimmy Wren, whom Armstrong
had continued in the voting trust&mdash;were served the attachment
papers.  By those papers, the Sheriff of New York
commanded that Armstrong's stock should not be released
from the voting trust until the attachment should be
satisfied.
</p>

<p>
Mansfield came to the office, read the papers, listened in
silence to Armstrong's furious outburst of denunciation.
Then he spoke, calmly.
</p>

<p>
"Surely, I warned you of such action, and you expected
it&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Such action as this?"  Armstrong struck the papers
violently.  "Do you realize that these charges have not a
particle of truth, of substantiation&mdash;that the suit is illegal,
the whole action a mockery of the law?"
</p>

<p>
Mansfield, imperturbably, assented.
</p>

<p>
"Quite so.  I realize, also, that we are helpless.  After
the election this suit will be dismissed.  Make up your
mind, sir, that Macgowan is going to vote your stock at this
meeting!  At any cost!  He cares not what punitive
action we take afterward.  He can fight that in the courts,
postpone retribution, evade from pillar to post.  In the
end, he must settle; before that time comes, he will have
milked Consolidated to the limit, and will be well able to
settle.  Our one hope is and must be to beat this trickster
by the votes of your stockholders."
</p>

<p>
Armstrong turned to Judge Holcomb, who was present
with Bruton.
</p>

<p>
"Can we do that, gentlemen?"
</p>

<p>
Bruton had been swiftly checking over a paper in his
hand.  Now he glanced up.
</p>

<p>
"We have at this moment one hundred votes in excess of
a majority."
</p>

<p>
"What?  You mean&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Even granting him the voting trust, Macgowan has lost.
Proxies for three hundred shares came in to-day.  We are
actually at this moment on the safe side, and with what
comes in during the next few days, we shall be indisputably
in control."
</p>

<p>
Mansfield rose.
</p>

<p>
"Gentlemen, I congratulate you on having won your own
fight.  I think you have no further need of my advice and
encouragement&mdash;for the present."
</p>

<p>
He bowed and departed, and left them still incredulous,
amazed by their own achievement, even now scarce able to
realize the swift change from defeat into victory.

<h3>
CHAPTER IX
</h3>

<p>
Dorothy had greatly desired to accompany
Armstrong to Wilmington; for, though she said
nothing of it to him, a premonition of evil was strong
upon her.  But nature denied the wish.  Dorothy was
given to sudden spells of illness, and her physical
condition was becoming manifest.  Further, she quite realized
the danger to her of a tense emotional and nervous strain
for days on end, such as this meeting would involve.
Reluctantly, she stayed at home.
</p>

<p>
On the day of the meeting, Armstrong left very early.
She went with him to the station, walking up and down as
they waited for the train.  On this day of all days, she
wanted to send forth her husband with the full and perfect
assurance of her love, with no drag of domestic anxiety to
weaken his efforts.  Yet, somewhere in the shadows of her
being, those casual words of her mother's lingered and
recurred to her mind; why it was, she refused to admit to
herself.
</p>

<p>
"I'm uneasy about Jimmy Wren," said Armstrong, as
they paced up and down.  "I'm afraid he's tied up with
some woman, and I don't like his close-mouthed ways about
it.  It's not natural for Jimmy to be reticent."
</p>

<p>
"Jimmy!" exclaimed Dorothy quickly.  "What woman?"
</p>

<p>
"That's just the point&mdash;I'm not even sure that the guess
is right.  But he's not been himself lately.  I heard him
getting a curb opinion out of Mansfield the other day, on
the divorce laws in this state, and I know he bought some
confoundedly expensive French perfume last week.  He's
been running into debt, too."
</p>

<p>
Dorothy halted.  "Reese!  Surely you don't think&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"There's nothing wrong, if that's what you mean;
Jimmy is square and clean.  But he's just the man to get
hooked by some gold-digger.  Well, I'll see about it later
if the chance comes&mdash;there's the train!"  Armstrong
turned and kissed her quickly.  "Take good care of
yourself, now!  If you need me, call the Wilmington office;
Wren will be in charge there and can get me in a hurry.
I'll call you up every day, at noon and evening, and let you
know how things go."
</p>

<p>
"There's only one way for them to go.  Good-by, dear,
and luck!"
</p>

<p>
She stood waving after him until the train had gone, then
returned to the car.  Her mind was busy with Jimmy
Wren, and in the days that followed she wondered more
than once about him, until more tragically important
affairs drove him from her thoughts.
</p>

<p>
Two days passed, and Reese Armstrong made uneventful
reports to her from Wilmington.  The meeting was going
slowly.  Nothing would be done until after the roll call of
the stockholders was taken, which would be on the third
or fourth day.  So far everything was excellent, and the
Protective Association apparently in decisive control.
</p>

<p>
Upon the morning of the third day, while Dorothy was
dressing, Slosson arrived at Aircastle Point.
</p>

<p>
Dorothy had passed a bad night, and her nerves were
quivering.  In her dreams, the voice of her mother had
again whispered that old doubt.  She no longer had any
great fear that any mental obsession would take hold of her,
and this was a bad sign.  Had Reese actually driven her
father out of Food Products?  She was wondering now,
this morning, whether she should bring up the whole
matter with Reese, as soon as his Wilmington battle was over;
she felt that he must be absolutely cleared in the eyes of
every one, Williams and the rest.  This, at least, was her
conscious thought.
</p>

<p>
She had no doubt that everything would be explained.
She told herself that her love and faith in Reese were
supreme, and she believed it.  None the less, the mental
reflex of her physical condition was a curious one&mdash;and one
that she did not realize.
</p>

<p>
It was at this moment that Slosson arrived.  Dorothy
heard his name with astonishment.
</p>

<p>
"At this hour!  What does he want?"
</p>

<p>
"He asked for Mr. Armstrong, and seemed a good deal
put out to learn he was gone," said the maid.  "Then he
asked for you.  He says it's extremely important."
</p>

<p>
"Tell him I'll be down in a few minutes."
</p>

<p>
Dorothy turned to her mirror, wondering at this
unheralded call from Pete Slosson.
</p>

<p>
Instantly there darted into her remembrance the thought
of how Slosson had spoken that day at the Waldorf&mdash;his
manner, rather than his words themselves.  He had been so
anxious to smooth over her mother's innocent remark, that
he must have known more than he said.
</p>

<p>
"I wish now I'd made him say more," reflected Dorothy,
giving her hair a final pat.  "He seemed genuinely uneasy
that day.  There was always a lot of good in Pete, for all
his reckless ways, and now he seems to have settled down&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She smiled at the reflection which told of her beauty, and
there was wonder in her smile, too.  For Dorothy was one
of those rare women who do not lose, but gain, by the added
life within them, and never had the fine, clear lines of her
face been so filled with a spiritual grace as now.
</p>

<p>
Pete Slosson was striding restlessly up and down the
living room when she found him.  At sight of her, he
turned.  There was no mistaking the light that sprang
into his face as he warmly gripped her hands, and this
look wakened a slight color in Dorothy's cheeks.
</p>

<p>
"Dot!" he exclaimed impulsively.  "Tell me where I
can reach Reese!  I called up his office when I reached New
York this morning, but couldn't get any information
except that he was not there and wouldn't be there to-day.  I
came on here, sure of catching him&mdash;and now he's gone!
I must get in touch with him immediately."
</p>

<p>
Her eyes widened on his.
</p>

<p>
"Why, Pete, you'll have to go to Wilmington!  He's
there, at the annual meeting of Consolidated.  There's a
big fight going on&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes, I know&mdash;but good heavens, Dot!  I have to
catch an afternoon train for Indianapolis, sure!"
</p>

<p>
Slosson stared at her, anxiety and dismayed hesitation
evident in his features.  He was better looking than of
old; cleaner about the eyes, firmer of mouth.  Dorothy
thought that he must have been not only prospering, but
behaving himself.
</p>

<p>
He refused to sit down, but resumed his nervous pacing
back and forth.
</p>

<p>
"This is terrible, Dot!" he burst out.  "I've risked
everything to come here&mdash;and now Reese is gone!  If I
could only get ten minutes with him&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Tell me, instead."  Dorothy realized that something
of serious import must be in the air; his agitated manner
conveyed the fact.  "Is it business?  Reese and I have no
secrets, Pete.  If you like, why not telephone?  I think we
can reach him."
</p>

<p>
"No, no, it's impossible!  I daren't telephone&mdash;or tell
you either&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He stopped short and stared at her, biting his lip.  In
his air was an alarmed hesitation, as though her
suggestion had startled and frightened him.
</p>

<p>
"I'll say frankly, Dot, that it's for your sake I've come
here to warn Reese.  I'm risking everything in doing it&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"For my sake?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."  He faced her squarely, on his lips a slight
smile tinged with bitterness.  "Your happiness has always
meant a good deal to me, Dot.  It's for your sake that I
came here&mdash;I'm not ashamed to admit it.  But I can't
deliver this warning to you.  There are things&mdash;oh, well, it's
out of the question."
</p>

<p>
"Reese and I have no secrets from each other," repeated
Dorothy quietly.
</p>

<p>
Slosson regarded her, smiling once more.  That smile
was a triumph of irony, of subtle suggestion, of tacit
implication.
</p>

<p>
"My dear Dot, I simply can't tell you what's going on!
I&mdash;hang it, I'd say too much.  Let me think.  If there
were only some way&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He turned his back to her and stared out of the window.
</p>

<p>
Dorothy was conscious of alarm stirring within her.
She had always suspected Pete Slosson of being a poseur,
a very clever actor where women were concerned.  At this
moment, she forgot everything except the implied suggestion
of his words.  The desperate earnestness of his manner
was convincing.
</p>

<p>
"You might leave a note," she began.
</p>

<p>
Slosson swung around on her with a quick, hard laugh.
</p>

<p>
"And implicate myself?  Not much.  I'm in it deep
enough already.  I never dreamed until too late how that
infernal Ried Williams must be working for Macgowan&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He broke off, shrugged, checked himself.
</p>

<p>
Mention of those names electrified Dorothy.  She leaned
forward.  Her brain leaped to the conclusion that here
was a chance to get some information, some warning, which
must reach Reese at once.  Perhaps it had something to
do with the Wilmington meeting, or could be used there.
It was her chance to help her husband.
</p>

<p>
"Sit down, Pete&mdash;sit down!" she said sharply.  "You
have to tell me what's on your mind.  I'm with Reese in
this fight against Macgowan.  Tell me, at once."
</p>

<p>
Slosson dropped into a chair.  Her incisive words seemed
to shatter his indecision.  He broke out into a petulant
flood of speech.
</p>

<p>
"Damn it, Dot, how can I tell you?  There are things
you don't know, never did know, must not know!  I don't
want to tell you&mdash;yet, if I don't reach Reese, it means
jail!  Can't you see the position I'm in?  If I tell you the
truth, I'm bound to hurt you deeply; and I don't want to
do that.  If I don't tell you, if I don't get this message
to Reese&mdash;it's jail for him."
</p>

<p>
His mental despair, his torturing uncertainty, lay
written in his face.
</p>

<p>
"Jail!" repeated Dorothy, low-voiced.  Slosson made a
gesture of assent, and dropped his chin on his breast.
From beneath lowered lids, he was watching keenly, however.
</p>

<p>
Dorothy's first impulse was to bid him go, leave his
message unspoken.  If Reese actually had any dark secret
which had been carefully kept from her knowledge, she
did not wish to know it.
</p>

<p>
The impulse was checked.  What had this to do with
Macgowan, with Ried Williams?  The thought was as a
goad to her spirit.  She leaned forward again to speak.
As Slosson glanced up, he met her eyes full.  Her blue-steel
gaze was so imperative, so penetrating, that the man
gave an involuntary start.
</p>

<p>
"Tell me the whole thing, Pete," she ordered swiftly.
"I have a right to know.  Out with it!"
</p>

<p>
Slosson gestured despairingly.
</p>

<p>
"I'll have to," he muttered.  "Reese is going to be
indicted in Illinois&mdash;perhaps has been indicted by now.  He
must act at once to save himself."
</p>

<p>
"Indicted!  For what?"
</p>

<p>
"For the way he handled Food Products&mdash;for fraud in
selling the stock."
</p>

<p>
Dorothy closed her eyes for an instant.  The dreaded
words had come; the impact of them burned her.  Food
Products!  And Slosson's bitter voice continued.
</p>

<p>
"Williams got me to sign the affidavits before I realized
what was going on.  If I'd dreamed that he was working
with Macgowan, that the affidavits were to be used&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Stop, wait!" exclaimed Dorothy, her eyes terrified.
"Tell me exactly what's the trouble, what he did that's
wrong!  I'll have to understand it all."
</p>

<p>
Slosson lowered his lids and looked down at his hands&mdash;perhaps
to hide the swift gleam of triumph he could not
keep from his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"As things stood, when your father was in charge, we
were unable to market that big stock-issue which would
have saved us.  Reese took hold and showed us how to
manage it.  We made a list of assets that was&mdash;well, it was
padded!  We filed our sworn statements with the various
state commissioners of securities, and got permission to
sell the stock.  Salvation was just in sight for the
company when your wedding-day came&mdash;and you know what
happened then.  Reese threw us all out and took over the
company."
</p>

<p>
Dorothy watched him with burning gaze.  Across her
face had slowly spread a mortal pallor.
</p>

<p>
"You don't mean that everything was prepared
before-hand&mdash;even that meeting in father's library, that
telegram&mdash;and what happened then?"
</p>

<p>
This was the moment of crisis, and Slosson met it firmly.
He lifted his face, white with the lie that was on his lips.
To Dorothy, it seemed the pallor of confession.  He met
her intent, flaming eyes, and nodded.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  We didn't expect it, of course.  Reese and
Macgowan and his man Wren had it all framed up.  They
knew we couldn't raise the money that telegram demanded&mdash;I
believe they arranged to have the telegram sent at the
proper time.  Wren came to Evansville, on the quiet,
about a month before your wedding, and looked up the
company's affairs thoroughly&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Wren did?" whispered Dorothy, her eyes wide and
stricken.  "Jimmy Wren?"
</p>

<p>
Slosson nodded, caught his breath sharply.
</p>

<p>
"He was only obeying orders, of course.  It was through
him that Reese handled things&mdash;showed us how to get that
stock issue on the market.  We never dreamed that the
company was going to be grabbed from us.  And," he
added reflectively, "I'm not blaming Reese for that.  I
don't think it was all his scheme.  I blame Macgowan,
for it was Macgowan who learned about all the details&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He came to his feet and resumed his restless pacing back
and forth.  "You see, Dot, Reese will have to act
immediately&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Why," suddenly struck in Dorothy, "why has Macgowan,
through all these weeks and months of bitter enmity,
never raised the question of this stock issue against
Reese?  Was he involved in it?"
</p>

<p>
Slosson shook his head.  "I don't think he even knew of
it until recently.  That was Armstrong's own private
affair; the Armstrong Company, you see, was to handle
the stock and sell it.  Of course, if Macgowan ever brings
up this matter it means the ruin of Reese.  And now
Macgowan knows about it, and is bringing it up.
</p>

<p>
"I've learned through Williams," he went on quickly,
"that Macgowan is obtaining an indictment against Reese
in Illinois, on charges of fraud in connection with the
stock sales.  That will amount to nothing, probably.  This
other business, however, can be raised against him
everywhere, in every state!  And Macgowan knows about it.
That's why Reese must act at once, get to Macgowan without
delay, call off the whole fight and patch up a peace!"
</p>

<p>
Dorothy started slightly.  For one instant she dimly
suspected the truth behind all this talk; for an instant
only.  It was gone at once and forgotten.
</p>

<p>
"He won't do that," she said steadily.  "He can't do
that, Pete.  He's fighting now for all the men and women
who believe in him, for the investors&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Slosson turned bitter eyes upon her.
</p>

<p>
"Have you fallen for that talk?"  He laughed harshly.
"Listen!  I want to help Reese&mdash;for your sake.  I want
to save him, if I can.  But don't give me that campaign
bunk&mdash;it's nothing else.  Listen to facts!  Don't you
know why he's pretending to fight for the sixteen thousand
investors?  Because that's his only possible shield.  If
Macgowan came out and charged him with wrecking Food
Products and stealing it from your father, Reese could
stand on his dignity and deny the charge.  But what can
he say to the law&mdash;to indictments and proof, and conviction?
A grand jury has to be shown facts.  If Macgowan
shows those affidavits that I signed with Williams&mdash;good
night!
</p>

<p>
"Don't think that Reese meant wrong," hurried on Slosson.
"He really saw only the one way to save Food Products,
and took it.  The rest of us had run things into the
ground, sure enough.  About this stock issue, he took the
same chances that four out of five business men take every
day.  Why, I can see now that when he kicked us all out,
it was for the best all around!  It's been the makings of
me.  And your father has realized that the company was
better off without him&mdash;he was glad to be saved from the
wreck at any price."
</p>

<p>
A faint tremor passed through Dorothy's body.  If
every word that Slosson was uttering had been craftily
calculated to pierce her heart, the end could not have been
better attained.
</p>

<p>
Slosson concluded rapidly.  "Dot, I tell you that this
man Macgowan is a terrible enemy.  He is vindictive,
cunning, treacherous!  He's all that's bad&mdash;and now he has
Reese absolutely by the neck.  Reese will be indicted and
jailed in every state where the stock was sold, unless he
acts at once and ends the fight with Macgowan."
</p>

<p>
Dorothy was watching him now with terrified eyes.  Her
doubts had fled, dissipated by his tremendous earnestness.
</p>

<p>
"But he can't give in&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"He has to.  Do you know whom I met on the train
coming to town?  Tom Windsor."
</p>

<p>
She was caught by the name.  Dorothy knew Tom
Windsor very well.  He was an Evansville boy, and every
one there knew him.  Now he was in Indianapolis, assistant
state's attorney general.  Dorothy, in common with
every one, knew him for a man of the most unimpeachable
integrity, of the most sterling character.  His name was
commonly linked with that of Federal Judge Sanderson&mdash;the
two men were known to stand for the same stern, rigid,
unwavering application of the law, Roman in its severity,
recognizing neither influence nor wealth nor position in
any offender.  It was Windsor who had placed the mayor
and entire council of one Indiana city in the penitentiary.
</p>

<p>
"You know Windsor," went on Slosson's voice.  "You
know there's nothing loose or crooked about him.  From
something he said to me on the train, I gathered that he
was coming to New York to see Macgowan.  Probably he
has been appointed special investigator into this Food
Products affair, and Macgowan will lay those affidavits
before him.  If Tom Windsor thought his own brother
guilty, he'd land him behind the bars!"
</p>

<p>
Dorothy caught her breath.  For a moment everything
went black before her; she recovered to find Slosson
gripping her arm, his face frightened, contrite.
</p>

<p>
"Oh&mdash;I'm sorry, I'm sorry!" he cried out.  In his
voice was a touch of real sincerity.  "I should never
have told you&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Please&mdash;go," she whispered faintly.
</p>

<p>
Slosson regarded her for a moment with a dejected and
mournful air, then he took his hat and went to the door.
There, he turned.
</p>

<p>
"Forgive me, Dot!  There was no other way&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She did not respond.  She did not even see him go.
After a time she found herself at the telephone, calling
the Wilmington office.  Presently Jimmy's voice came to
her.
</p>

<p>
"Tell me, please!"  She wondered at the cool steadiness
of her own tone.  All her brain was in a mad tumult.
"Tell me&mdash;were you in Evansville about a month before
Reese and I were married?  Were you making arrangements
then, gathering information and all, for that Food
Products reorganization?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, sure!" came the surprised answer.  "I didn't
know that any one knew of it, but I was on the job all
right.  Why?"
</p>

<p>
"All right&mdash;good-by."
</p>

<p>
Dorothy hung up the receiver.  The warning which she
was supposed to deliver had been stricken out of her mind.
Trembling, she dropped her face in her hands.
</p>

<p>
"True&mdash;it's all true!" she moaned.  "Oh&mdash;Reese!  And
I would have stuck to you through everything&mdash;"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER X
</h3>

<p>
From  the moment when Lawrence Macgowan, as secretary
of Consolidated Securities, called the annual
meeting to order, a sense of impending drama filled
the auditorium.  The Gayety Theater!  What irony in the
name!  Here was a struggle for more than life and death,
a titanic combat between looters and looted.
</p>

<p>
Every one knew that the issue lay between Armstrong
and Macgowan; the batteries of lawyers and advisers and
experts and friends were but incidentals of the stage
setting.  The life of Consolidated was at stake&mdash;now this
outward and visible symbol of sixteen thousand investors
would either be saved to its owners, or would be despoiled
and bled white.
</p>

<p>
From the start, Macgowan let himself go full sweep, in
all his real nature.  Arbitrary, domineering, a sneering
viciousness in eyes and voice, he ruled the meeting with
a hand of iron.  Save for his own little group, the
hundreds of people around were enemies; they hated, feared,
distrusted him&mdash;and were helpless before him.
</p>

<p>
Macgowan, knowing that these people had gathered to
watch his power stripped away, took savage pleasure in
making them feel that power, in making them feel their
own impotence before him, in making them realize that
he, and he alone, was the master of Consolidated Securities.
</p>

<p>
And people had gathered to watch.  Several hundred
were here, the majority from near-by points, others from a
distance.  These, almost to a man, were behind Armstrong
and his committee.  Before and during the meeting they
were thronging about the hotel rooms, shaking hands,
encouraging, pouring their enthusiasm and confidence into
the men who were fighting for them.
</p>

<p>
While that long roll of the thousands of investors was
being called they sat silent, tense, listening and checking off
proxies.  Never was the magnificent audacity of Macgowan
more manifest than now, as he sat there snarling at those
who had come to pull him from his position of power.
</p>

<p>
This arrogant, confident manner of Macgowan's was
causing Armstrong worry; he sought for the reason
perpetually, and found none.  Hour after hour went by.  The
first day dragged out its length, the second followed.
Somewhere in the crowd Armstrong caught a glimpse
of a sallow, saturnine visage, lost it again instantly; after
a time he remembered that darkly vulpine countenance as
the face of Ried Williams.  Williams!  What was the
man doing here?  No matter.
</p>

<p>
And now the third day of the meeting.  That afternoon
would be finished the long roll of the sixteen thousand
and more investors.
</p>

<p>
With each name that was called, during these two days
and a half, the Protective Association showed its power
more clearly.  The proxies held by Macgowan's satellites
were clearly in the minority.  As the totals mounted up,
victory became more and more assured to Armstrong.
And ever Mansfield sat aloof in thoughtful silence,
scrutinizing every word and act of the opposition with that
lightning brain of his ready to pounce; and Macgowan,
realizing his peril, stepped cautiously.
</p>

<p>
Noon came&mdash;noon of the third day.
</p>

<p>
It was an exultant noontide.  Sessions was holding the
newspaper and financial writers at bay; Judge Holcomb
and Doctor Bruton rested.  Armstrong and Mansfield
lunched with Robert Dorns, who had come down to enjoy
the triumph.  Calling up Aircastle Point, Armstrong was
told that Dorothy was asleep, and left word for her of
the victory.
</p>

<p>
The afternoon session opened with a growing tension.
The finish was in sight.  The last of the T's was called,
and the end would now come soon.  Armstrong heard the
droning rasp of Macgowan's voice, heard the responses,
mechanically checked off his own list.  He swiftly
computed his figures.  Close&mdash;but certain!
</p>

<p>
"We've beaten the voting trust!" he thought
exultantly.  "Beaten it!"
</p>

<p>
True.  Of the thirty-five thousand shares of common
outstanding, the Association would vote a full nineteen
thousand.  Macgowan, despite his control of the voting
trust, would lose by fifteen hundred votes.  The illegal
attachment had not availed him&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Suddenly Armstrong's head shot up.  He was conscious
of the electrified thrill that passed through the entire
audience.  He was conscious of a new name, not on his
list, which had passed the lips of Macgowan.
</p>

<p>
It was the name of Ried Williams.
</p>

<p>
A dead, tense hush fell upon all, through which pierced
the voice of Williams in its response.  The wondering
surprise passed into a low gasp of incredulity.  Macgowan
sat sneering, defiant, his gaze sweeping about in exultant
challenge.  The faces that stared up at him had lost their
glow of confidence and triumph; consternation was in
every eye, a dismayed stupefaction, despair!
</p>

<p>
Armstrong was dumbfounded, staggered.  For Ried
Williams answered for ten thousand shares!
</p>

<p>
A low mutter passed through the crowd; it swelled
and swelled into a vibrant, angry roar of protest.  The
supercilious smile vanished from the lips of Findlater.
Macgowan, furious, bellowed for silence.  At last, unable
to get it, he held out his hand toward the standing figure
of Mansfield in tacit permission.  The uproar quieted.
</p>

<p>
As Mansfield voiced objection, Armstrong's attention
was suddenly dragged away.  He found Jimmy Wren at
his elbow, gripping his arm, agitated and tense.
</p>

<p>
"Come to the telephone&mdash;long distance&mdash;French at
Chicago wants you&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Damn the telephone!"  Armstrong was trying to catch
Mansfield's voice.  "Tell 'em&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You've got to come!  It's the Chicago office&mdash;come and
hear for yourself!  It's more important than anything
here&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
One look into the eyes of Wren, and Armstrong obeyed.
He rose, suffered Wren to pilot him out, wondering what
new stroke of fate was to fall upon him.  Ten thousand
shares that did not exist!  This was more than audacity;
it was insolence.  Macgowan could never get away with
such action as this.  He had passed the limit at last.  His
effrontery had now over-reached itself&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Hello!"  Armstrong spoke into the telephone.
"Armstrong speaking.  Who is it?"
</p>

<p>
He listened for a moment; his face changed.  A start
escaped him, as though from some invisible blow.
</p>

<p>
"What's that again?" he demanded vibrantly.  "Repeat it!"
</p>

<p>
Then, after a moment: "All right, French.  Don't
lose any sleep over it.  Much obliged to you."
</p>

<p>
He hung up the receiver and turned to Jimmy Wren.
He was laughing, but his eyes were dancing with the
cold flame of sun-smitten ice.
</p>

<p>
"You heard, Jimmy?  Want to start for Europe?"
</p>

<p>
Jimmy Wren gaped at him, then grinned and swung
palm to palm with a hearty grip.
</p>

<p>
"Damn Europe!  I'm with you till hell freezes over,
and you know it!"
</p>

<p>
"All right.  Let's get back&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He was too late.  He found that the meeting had been
adjourned until next morning.  Cursing, angry men were
pouring from the place.  He encountered Mansfield and
Dorns in company; the lawyer was white with suppressed
fury.  Dorns regarded Armstrong grimly and bit hard
at a cigar.
</p>

<p>
"Well?" demanded Armstrong, as they got clear of the
crowd.  "Did you stop him?"
</p>

<p>
Mansfield shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"There was a directors' meeting a week ago&mdash;a secret
one," he said crisply.  "Ten thousand shares of stock
were issued to Ried Williams.  His note for five thousand
dollars was issued in payment.  Then the transfer books
were closed."
</p>

<p>
Armstrong froze.
</p>

<p>
"Note&mdash;five thousand!" he said, unbelieving.  "For
stock worth two hundred thousand on the market?
Impossible!"
</p>

<p>
"It is illegal, but it's not impossible," said Mansfield.
"It is a fact.  All Macgowan wants is to remain in power.
This gives him a clear voting majority, of course."
</p>

<p>
Armstrong pulled himself together.
</p>

<p>
"Wait!" he said.  "Wait!  There's something else you
don't know&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The two men looked at him, startled by his manner.  He
met the gaze of Dorns, and laughed bitterly.
</p>

<p>
"Good thing you're here, Dorns," he said.  "I just
had a long distance call from our Chicago manager.  He
had some information for me.  I've been indicted in
Springfield, Illinois, for perjury in connection with the
sale of Food Products stock.  Macgowan wanted the indictment
for use during the campaign, of course&mdash;well, he has
it now."
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap0211"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XI
</h3>

<p>
"The difference between you and Macgowan," said
Robert Dorns, "is that he's got the law on his
side&mdash;and you're on the side of the law.  It ain't
much difference at first sight, but when you get down to
cases it's a whale of a difference!"
</p>

<p>
Armstrong smiled wearily.
</p>

<p>
They were in Armstrong's rooms at the hotel&mdash;Dorns,
Mansfield, Bruton, Holcomb and Sessions.  Jimmy Wren
listened in a corner.  It was the evening of the third day;
and in another room Armstrong's full battery of legal
experts were arguing and contending, vainly striving to
find some way out of the disaster.  Mansfield knew the
fight was lost, and admitted it.  The committee of three
admitted it.  The silence of Dorns, who never admitted
anything, was eloquent.
</p>

<p>
Armstrong alone refused to admit defeat.
</p>

<p>
"I was talking with Garvin to-night," said Mansfield
slowly.  "He's their chief counsel, you know.  He
intimated that Findlater would be glad to make some
peaceful settlement."
</p>

<p>
Judge Holcomb made a despondent gesture.
</p>

<p>
"They have us, of course.  Shall we open negotiations,
Armstrong?"
</p>

<p>
"Not with my consent," replied Armstrong.  "We have
won our fight honestly.  They have beaten us by illegal
trickery.  If Findlater and Macgowan are elected by
means of this block of ten thousand votes, I mean to
contest it."
</p>

<p>
Mansfield regarded him quietly.
</p>

<p>
"Look at the facts impartially," he said.  "It is true
that their actions are illegal.  It is true that this farcical
stock issue to Williams was made merely to carry the
election, just as that indictment in Illinois was obtained
merely to discredit you.  It is true that we shall obtain
the dismissal of this indictment, that we can contest the
election, and that we must ultimately win the fight&mdash;if we
push it.
</p>

<p>
"But, my dear fellow, do we want to push it?  Is the
game worth the candle?  Ask yourself that question
fairly.  Garvin intimated to me to-night that Findlater
would be only too glad to throw Macgowan overboard and
make peace.  There has been friction between them;
Findlater, I think, is terrified by Macgowan's audacity and
absolute disregard for any legal ethics.  Now is our time
to compromise, get what we can out of their differences!
Garvin is in this hotel now.  If you'll let me interview
him, I fancy that he'll be all ready to present terms for
our acceptance."
</p>

<p>
"I don't compromise," said Armstrong quietly.
</p>

<p>
"Then give in, surrender!" put in Judge Holcomb,
gloomily enough.  "Consider what a protracted fight will
involve, Reese!  It means that we'll be battling in the
courts for months to come, perhaps years.  It means
lengthy and continuous expense&mdash;and you know what this
campaign has cost us.  What if we win?  We get nothing
out of it.  Macgowan can juggle the books of Consolidated
and use the investors' money to fight us&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"That's exactly it," said Armstrong.  "He's fighting
us with our own money!  And if we fail, he'll rob us.
We must not fail."
</p>

<p>
"Besides," spoke up Doctor Bruton, "consider the effect
upon the company itself, Reese!  Already this fight has
hurt it tremendously."
</p>

<p>
"Not as much as Macgowan has hurt it," said
Armstrong.  "Not as much as he will hurt it!"
</p>

<p>
They were silent for a moment, staring at him.  Then
Robert Dorns moved in his chair, took his cigar from his
mouth, and spoke.
</p>

<p>
"Listen here, Armstrong.  Who's runnin' Consolidated
now?"
</p>

<p>
"Macgowan, of course."
</p>

<p>
"If he's out o' the company, who's runnin' it?"
</p>

<p>
Armstrong was silent a space, his gaze fastened on
Dorns, his lips compressed.
</p>

<p>
"I see," he said at length.  "Yes.  I see."
</p>

<p>
Dorns waved his cigar, drove home his point.
</p>

<p>
"We ain't in this fight for selfish reasons, but for the
good of the company.  Now, at the very minute Macgowan
gets into the saddle&mdash;what happens?  His crowd goes back
on him.  Findlater is ready to ditch him.  S'pose we make
terms?
</p>

<p>
"Then our stock is back in control.  Leave Findlater
there if we have to!  Believe me, when we're dealin' with
Findlater and not Macgowan, we can handle him!  It's
Macgowan's infernal brains that have been makin' this
fight, me lad; don't mistake that.  Why not let Mansfield
have a little talk, learn what we can do?  They can't
put anything over on Q. Adams, and you know it!"
</p>

<p>
Armstrong was silent again.  Then he rose to his feet.
</p>

<p>
"Go ahead, Mansfield," he said.  "I'm going to
telephone my wife&mdash;excuse me."
</p>

<p>
He went into the adjacent room and closed the door.
</p>

<p>
For a little he was unable to get a connection; he waited.
At length he heard the maid's voice on the line, and asked
for Dorothy.  Another wait.  Then came the voice of
Dorothy, coolly speaking his name.  Something in her
tone startled him.
</p>

<p>
"Are you well, lady?"
</p>

<p>
"Well enough in body, Reese," she said.  "Not in
mind.  There is something you must do for me."
</p>

<p>
"Yes?  What is it?"
</p>

<p>
"Make peace with Macgowan."
</p>

<p>
Armstrong was staggered.  "What do you mean, Dorothy?"
</p>

<p>
"I can't explain over the telephone.  Will you do it?"
</p>

<p>
He laughed shortly.  "Very likely.  We've been beaten.
We're discussing peace terms now.  But what on earth
made you ask me to do such a thing?"
</p>

<p>
"A belated understanding of some things, Reese."
</p>

<p>
"Good heavens, Dot, what's happened?  Why, you
speak as though something were wrong!"  He heard her
laugh without mirth.
</p>

<p>
"No, nothing's wrong.  When shall you be home?"
</p>

<p>
"Not to-night.  Probably to-morrow morning, unless you
need me now.  Do you?"
</p>

<p>
"No, dear.  Morning will do.  Good-by, and all luck!"
</p>

<p>
Armstrong dropped into a chair, a prey to furious
indecision and tumultuous thought.  From the very tone
Dorothy had used, he knew that something was amiss,
something had happened at home.  What was it?  What
on earth had caused that coldness in her voice?
</p>

<p>
It did not occur to him then that Macgowan might have
struck him in a vital spot.
</p>

<p>
He was tempted to rush home at once, seek the cause of
the trouble, remove it.  Dorothy had said no word, yet he
understood that for some reason she was angered against
him.  But he could not leave here now; it was impossible.
</p>

<p>
A knock at the door.  Mansfield appeared, closed the
door behind him, looked at Armstrong.  He seemed
startled by the tortured face, the distracted frown, that
met his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Reese!  What's happened?  Anything new come up?"
</p>

<p>
"No."  Armstrong made a vague gesture.  "Some
trouble at home&mdash;I don't know what.  I feel buffeted on
every side&mdash;a whirlwind all around me&mdash;storm&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Mansfield regarded him in a singular manner.
</p>

<p>
"God is never in the whirlwind," he said, his voice and
his words strange.  "Always in the still, small voice."
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?"  Armstrong looked up, caught by
the extraordinary air of the lawyer.  "Eh?"
</p>

<p>
Mansfield's face changed, altered to its usual dry alertness.
He shrugged, took a cigar from his pocket, lighted
it, sat down.
</p>

<p>
"I have an offer direct from Findlater," he said, and
looked at Armstrong.  "Before presenting it, I wish to
say that the answer must come from you alone.  I cannot
advise you.  I can say only one thing: Consider it well!
It is the only offer that we can get."
</p>

<p>
"Name it," said Armstrong, collecting himself.
</p>

<p>
"The election of officers takes place to-morrow.
Findlater agrees to drop Macgowan from all connection with
Consolidated.  This means that Macgowan will fight
bitterly.  In order to insure beating him, the Stockholders'
Protective Association is to throw its votes to Findlater
and continue him in office.  The issue of ten thousand
shares to Williams will be withdrawn.  Holcomb and
Bruton will be placed on the directorate."
</p>

<p>
Armstrong stared.
</p>

<p>
"You say that the Association must vote with Findlater?"
</p>

<p>
"That is the <i>sine qua non</i>.  No counter offer will be
considered.  The answer must come at once."
</p>

<p>
Armstrong fell into thought.
</p>

<p>
The offer was seemingly fair enough.  Macgowan would
be smashed utterly and beyond recall&mdash;this was certain.
Victory!  Judge Holcomb and Doctor Bruton would
become directors.  It would mean a tremendous personal
triumph for Armstrong&mdash;
</p>

<p>
At a price.
</p>

<p>
He started, stung to the quick as he perceived the truth.
Now he saw why Mansfield would give no advice, why the
answer to this proposal must come from him and from no
other!
</p>

<p>
Week after week, by letter and word of mouth and press
notices, the present management of Consolidated Securities
had been under the bitterest fire from the Association.  The
attack had been directed overwhelmingly against Findlater
and his associates.  They had been publicly exposed
and branded as grafters, thieves, looters.  Under the
surface, the attack was upon Macgowan, but Findlater and
his associates were the ostensible targets.
</p>

<p>
It was for the overthrow of this management that the
Protective Association had been working day and night.
The object of this whole campaign had been that of getting
Consolidated Securities into honest hands, out of
Findlater's grip.  For that purpose proxies were held from
far and near, thousands of them, proxies of those who had
entrusted their votes to the Protective Association, for
the common cause, for the common welfare.
</p>

<p>
A harsh, hard laugh rang from Armstrong.
</p>

<p>
"Did Garvin make you this proposal?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Mansfield, imperturbable and cold.
</p>

<p>
"You have a singular code of legal ethics in these
parts," said Armstrong, his voice like acid.  "Garvin
stands remarkably high as a lawyer&mdash;almost as high as you
do, Mansfield.  But I know lawyers out West who would
kick a client out of the office if they asked him to carry
such a proposal as this."
</p>

<p>
Mansfield's face stirred slightly, wakened from its cold
calm.
</p>

<p>
"Garvin," he said after a moment, "will resign as chief
counsel to Consolidated.  He bore the message as a part
of his duty, and so informed me."
</p>

<p>
"In that case," said Armstrong, "I should be glad to
retain his services."
</p>

<p>
Mansfield raised his brows.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  But your answer to this proposal?"
</p>

<p>
"There can be but one answer," said Armstrong.  "They
ask us to betray the people who have trusted us, to take
these votes, given for the express purpose of removing
Findlater's management, and use them to retain that
management.  In order to do this, they try to bribe me,
to appeal to my personal enmity, by kicking Macgowan
out."
</p>

<p>
"If you refuse," answered the lawyer reflectively, "it
accomplishes nothing.  If you refuse, Macgowan remains
in power; the issue of stock to Williams will stand; the
Association faces a blank wall.  You are under indictment.
You will be discredited among many of the investors.  I
merely present these facts that you may understand the
situation."
</p>

<p>
Armstrong laughed bitterly.
</p>

<p>
"Don't worry&mdash;I understand them!  Go out there and
tell Holcomb and the others about it.  Tell them that my
answer is: No!  Tell them to quit if they want to.  I
shall go on fighting, alone.  That is all."
</p>

<p>
For a moment Mansfield studied the unyielding face of
Armstrong, then rose.
</p>

<p>
"Ah&mdash;perhaps you do not recall what Philip de
Commines said of his royal master?  He said: 'I never
knew any man so wise in his misfortunes.'  To be wise in
misfortune, Mr. Armstrong, is to overcome fate.  I&mdash;by
gad, sir, I congratulate you with all my heart upon this
decision!  You shall not go on fighting alone."
</p>

<p>
He held out his hand.  Armstrong gripped it, and was
astonished to perceive that the eyes of this man were
suffused with emotion.
</p>

<p>
Thus ended the Wilmington meeting.

<h3>
CHAPTER XII
</h3>

<p>
It was after ten the next morning when Armstrong
entered his own home.
</p>

<p>
Wearily, he discarded his things and turned to the
living room, where he glimpsed the figure of Dorothy.
Why she had not come to meet him, he did not know or
care.  He thought only of the news he bore, hesitating to
face her with word of complete defeat.  He was overwhelmed
by a sense of futility.  Even though the defeat
were temporary, even though his conscience were clear,
even though that indictment were certain to be
dismissed&mdash;what was being gained by a prolonged fight?
</p>

<p>
"I might still get out of it, turn over my Consolidated
stock to Findlater, and be rid of it all," he thought in
despondency.  "I've failed at every point, and might
better acknowledge it.  I could go to work at something
else&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
So the temptation gnawed, as he came forward to join
his wife.  He was too dejected even to observe her manner
or the distinct challenge of her greeting.  He threw
himself into a chair and stared at the fire.
</p>

<p>
"I've failed," he said abruptly.  "Macgowan has beaten
us all along the line, lady.  Last night we tried to
compromise, and failed.  We've lost, but he's beaten us
illegally; we'll fight on and in the end, we'll win.  But
that's not the worst news I have."
</p>

<p>
Dorothy did not answer.  Armstrong stole a glance,
found her gaze fastened steadily upon him.  Something
in her eyes frightened him.  He realized that she had not
welcomed him home.
</p>

<p>
"Dot!  What's the matter?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing," she responded calmly.  "I'm sorry you
were beaten, Reese.  I have some news for you, too, but
finish what you have to say."
</p>

<p>
The dreadful quietude of her manner shook him to the
depths.  One blow after another had reached him; now
he began to fear something vaster and deeper&mdash;he knew
not what.
</p>

<p>
"I've been indicted in Illinois for perjury, in
connection with Food Products stock," he said.  "Macgowan
got the indictment in order to discredit me.  He got it
fraudulently and it'll be dismissed.  But it's one more
thing."
</p>

<p>
"I know."
</p>

<p>
Armstrong jerked up his head.  "You know?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  A man was here to warn you.  He told me.
I learned other things, too.  That is not the only
indictment you'll have to face; Macgowan is going to push you
to the wall.  And, Reese, I'm afraid he can do it."
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean, Dot?  What do you know?"
</p>

<p>
"I know everything."  A hot torrent of words broke
from her.  "Everything, Reese!  I know how you've
deceived me all this time; I've suspected it a long while,
but now I know it.  How you planned everything, took
advantage of our wedding-day, even postponed our
wedding in order that you might steal father's company
from him.  I've stuck by you through it all, Reese.  I've
tried to do my duty by you, tried to make my love and
faith blind to everything; but now a time has come to
speak.  You must give up this fight against Macgowan,
at once, to-day!"
</p>

<p>
"Stop, stop!"' cried out Armstrong.  The agonized
incredulity of his voice made her wince, but her steely eyes
remained steady.  "Dot, you don't know what you're
saying!  Good heavens, girl&mdash;do you realize what you're
charging me with?  It's preposterous!"
</p>

<p>
Sudden anger blazed in Dorothy's face.
</p>

<p>
"Can you deny that you planned to take father's
company away from him?  Can you deny that it was all
arranged in advance, with this same Macgowan?  Can
you deny that at the very hour we were to be married,
you were robbing my father of his life-work&mdash;basely
striking him in the back?  And then you dared to complain
when Macgowan turned on you and did the same to you,
after I had given you warnings!  Poor father, there was
none to warn <i>him</i>."
</p>

<p>
"Dot!" exclaimed Armstrong, in bewildered horror of
her words.  "Don't say&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Can you deny these things?" she persisted coldly.
</p>

<p>
"Absolutely!"  Armstrong came to his feet.  "It's a
lie, all of it!  A cursed lie!  Dot, I give you my word of
honor&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Don't," she said coldly.  "I don't believe you."
</p>

<p>
These words delivered the worst blow that Armstrong
had ever received.  For a moment he actually reeled under
their impact, disbelieving his own senses.  He stared at
Dorothy from distended eyes; then a rush of frightful
anger flamed into his face.
</p>

<p>
"You don't believe me!" he repeated.  "God forgive
you for saying such a thing&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, let's have no heroics, Reese," she intervened.  Her
savage and relentless cruelty stung him to the very soul.
"I've discovered the whole affair, and now I am laying a
choice before you.  I know why you are fighting Macgowan
so desperately.  I know why you pretend to fight on
behalf of the sixteen thousand investors&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Pretend!" he uttered in a strangled voice.  "Pretend!"
</p>

<p>
"&mdash;and now it is going to end."  She was cold, inexorable,
emotionless.  "You may as well learn that if you
keep up this fight, you'll end by being branded as a felon.
I would stick by you through that disgrace, Reese, if it
were achieved in a just cause.  Now that I know the
truth, now that I know retribution is upon you for what
you did to my father&mdash;it's all ended for me."
</p>

<p>
She paused an instant, then went on.
</p>

<p>
"Go and see Macgowan.  It may be too late, but at
least make the effort.  Give up this fight.  Abandon this
righteous pose of yours, and be done with it.  Either that,
or I shall leave this house immediately."
</p>

<p>
Armstrong was stupefied.  He could only stand staring
at her like a man paralyzed.
</p>

<p>
The most frightful part of it was his absolute ignorance
of what had so aroused her anger and bitterness.  He
could not imagine how she had gained this idea that he
had stolen her father's company, that retribution for such
a theft was facing him.  This was all so preposterous to
him that he could not even view the accusation in any
correct perspective.
</p>

<p>
And then the scorn of her words reached to the quick,
seared him intolerably.  That she should so turn upon
him in this hour of defeat and black despair, evoked from
him a passionate fury.
</p>

<p>
"Tell me what's behind all this!" he demanded hotly.
"Out with it, Dot!  What basis have you for uttering such
damnable lies about me?"
</p>

<p>
He received a frigid glance.
</p>

<p>
"That is gentlemanly language to use, Reese," was her
response.  "I was not brought up to hear such words
addressed to me&mdash;but I shan't argue with you.  Do you
intend to give up this fight or not?"
</p>

<p>
"Dot, listen to me!" he broke out frantically,
desperately.  "Whatever has come over you, at least listen
to me!  Surely you can't ask such a thing, in all sanity?
Oh, the devil himself must be in this!  You can't mean
it, Dot; you've been with me from the first, helping and
backing me&mdash;and now you ask that I submit!  You know
I'm not fighting for myself alone&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Her eyes, dark with anger, flashed at this.
</p>

<p>
"I thought it was not for yourself, but I've learned
better.  I've learned that you are using these investors
as a shield for yourself.  Do you think it's for myself
alone that I'm making this demand?  No, no!  It's not
for my sake that I want this mad obstinacy of yours
abandoned!"
</p>

<p>
The wild vehemence of her words frightened him, sent
him into a cold chill of stark terror.  He had never seen
her in so blazing an anger, so passionate a fury&mdash;he had
not dreamed such a condition would be possible to Dorothy
Armstrong.
</p>

<p>
"I'll not have my child branded the child of a felon!"
she rushed on in an impetuous burst.  "I know better
than you yourself where you are heading; so far as I'm
concerned, it ends now!  My marriage vow to you has
ended.  My obligations to you have ended.  What I now
have to do, is to live and act and hope for the child that I
shall bring into the world.  If you persist in your course,
the blame is not mine but yours.  I am giving you your
chance."
</p>

<p>
Armstrong was absolutely stunned, as much by the
savage conviction of her manner as by what she said.  He
comprehended that she was speaking from a terrible
sincerity&mdash;but he could not understand it.
</p>

<p>
"Dot&mdash;"  He checked himself, paused, forced himself
into a semblance of calmer speech.  "Dot, I swear before
heaven that I don't know what you're talking about!
Somehow, Macgowan must have reached you&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"He has not.  Will you give up this fight, or give me
up?" she demanded coldly.
</p>

<p>
He was terrified afresh by her air.
</p>

<p>
"I can't talk about it now, Dot.  I'm all unstrung&mdash;in
no shape to think or speak calmly.  I can only hope that
what you've said is assignable to your condition, that you
can't realize what you are saying&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You dare to attack my sanity, do you?" she burst
forth.
</p>

<p>
Armstrong made a despairing gesture.  "I'm not attacking
you&mdash;for heaven's sake, Dot, try and be calm!"  The
cry was wrenched from him.  "We'll take this thing up
again after luncheon, dear; I'll have to learn what's in
your mind.  You know I'll not give up this fight.  You
know I simply can't give up, abandon the people who
trust and look to me!  I'll not do it, no matter who
asks it."
</p>

<p>
"Very well.  If that's your decision&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"It is my decision&mdash;and I'll not change it!" he
exclaimed in a gust of anger.  "It's bitterly wrong of you
to ask such a thing.  But let all that go now, Dot; we'll
take it up after luncheon and thrash it out calmly.  I'll
have to get calmed down a bit."
</p>

<p>
He turned and strode from the room, and so upstairs.
</p>

<p>
There in his own room, he strove desperately to get
himself in hand.  The touch of cold water on his skin cooled
his blood, but only made him more aware of the awful
chaos into which he was plunged.  Who was responsible
for this attitude on the part of Dorothy?  What had
caused it?
</p>

<p>
He changed his clothes, his brain in tumult.  Dorothy
seemed to know as much as he did about this indictment.
He was frightened, too; in her condition she was receptive
to delusion, obsession, madness!  This thought made him
frantic in his very solicitude for her, and lessened his
resentment of her words and manner.  It was not his wife
who had been speaking downstairs&mdash;it was the woman who
carried a child under her heart, the woman whose entire
physical and nervous system was for the moment thrown
out of balance.
</p>

<p>
He was longer than usual about dressing, but at length
descended the stairs.  At their foot, he encountered the
maid, and thought that she regarded him with a singular
air.  He halted her curtly.
</p>

<p>
"Who was here yesterday or the day before?"
</p>

<p>
"Nobody, sir, but a Mr. Slosson, I think the name
was&mdash;yesterday morning early."
</p>

<p>
"Slosson!"  The name broke from Armstrong.  He
clenched his lips for an instant, and flung an appearance
of calm into his reply.  "Very well.  You may serve
luncheon whenever it's ready."
</p>

<p>
"It's ready now, sir."  The maid's face was frightened.
"If&mdash;if Mrs. Armstrong is coming back&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Coming back?"  Armstrong looked at the maid with
terrible eyes.  "What do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"She called the car and went out, just after you went
upstairs, sir.  And&mdash;and she had her traveling-bag&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Armstrong put out a hand to the stair-rail.  For a
moment he stood speechless, his face gray as death.  The
maid started forward to stay him from falling, then she
shrank back from his burning gaze.
</p>

<p>
"Never mind luncheon," he said thickly.

"A MAN'S HEART DEVISETH HIS WAY"
</h2>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER I
</h3>

<p>
Upon the Saturday after the triumphal return
from Wilmington, Lawrence Macgowan sat in the
office that had once belonged to Armstrong.  A
thin, malicious smile drew at his lips as he studied a typed
document which lay on the desk before him.  He leaned
back and lighted a cigar, laughing silently and amusedly
to himself.
</p>

<p>
The door opened, to admit Findlater.
</p>

<p>
"Good morning, Mr. President!" exclaimed Macgowan
heartily.  "I was just thinking about you!  Come in and
make yourself at home."
</p>

<p>
Findlater, looking well pleased with the world, lowered
himself into a chair.  Success had agreed with him.  It
had even given him a slightly superior air with Macgowan.
</p>

<p>
"Er&mdash;something I'd like to inquire about, Mac.  How
do you expect to meet these suits that have been brought
by Armstrong's crowd?"
</p>

<p>
Macgowan waved his cigar genially.  "Tut, tut, my boy!
Never worry over little things like that."
</p>

<p>
"But it may become serious."  Findlater frowned, as
though displeased by this light response.  "Everything's
being done in my name, and I should have a clear idea
of the program ahead of us."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, leave the legal affairs to me," and Macgowan's
shoulders shook in a hearty laugh.  "Haven't I taken care
of them pretty well so far?"
</p>

<p>
Findlater reddened.  He was ruffled, irritated by this
evasion.
</p>

<p>
"Confound it, Mac, why can't you be talked to?  Why,
look at Armstrong!  He'd let a man sit down and talk
an hour.  With all his cursed blue-law character, he'd
listen to any proposition&mdash;he's big enough to do it.  But
not you.  Why are you stalling about these suits?"
</p>

<p>
Macgowan's eyes narrowed, then a smile crept into them;
not a nice smile.  This unfavorable comparison with his
enemy, particularly coming from Findlater, stung him
unbearably.
</p>

<p>
"All right, have your way&mdash;and pay for it," he said,
a rasp in his voice.  "You want to know how I'm going
to deal with that crowd, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"Exactly.  But what do you mean by paying for it?"
</p>

<p>
Macgowan waved this query aside, ignored it temporarily.
</p>

<p>
"Armstrong's going to give up this fight," he said,
mouthing his cigar and regarding Findlater with an air
which appeared to cause that gentleman some uneasiness.
"Our suits against Armstrong can be dismissed any time
now.  As for the suits against us, they can be postponed.
All we want is delay.  Armstrong will give up."
</p>

<p>
Findlater grunted.  "Maybe&mdash;and maybe not.  I know
Armstrong as well as you do."
</p>

<p>
"Not quite as well.  You don't know where he's
vulnerable; I do."  Macgowan chuckled.  "He's the heart
and soul of the crowd that's fighting us.  If he quits,
we'll have a clean sweep, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," admitted Findlater.
</p>

<p>
Macgowan smiled as he regarded his confederate.
</p>

<p>
"D'you know what's happened?  Armstrong's wife has
left him&mdash;gone home."
</p>

<p>
Findlater stared for a long moment, until gradual
realization came to him.  Something in the voice and eye
of Macgowan wakened his comprehension, conveyed to his
brain that these brief words not only constituted a
statement of fact, but also held a note of triumphant boasting.
</p>

<p>
Even Findlater was stupefied by this admission.  Bad
though he was, Findlater had certain bounds which he
disliked to cross.
</p>

<p>
"Lord!" he ejaculated.  "You&mdash;Mac, you didn't do
this?"
</p>

<p>
"I?"  Macgowan's brows went up.  "Certainly not,
certainly not!  I've not spoken a word to Mrs. Armstrong
in months."
</p>

<p>
A momentary snarl lifted his lip, as the memory of that
scene in the Waldorf smote into him.  The snarl crept
into his voice as he went on speaking.
</p>

<p>
"But I'll not say that I knew nothing about it.  When
I go after a man, Findlater, he's gone!  I went after
Armstrong, and I'll finish him.  You thought during the
campaign that I was taking wild chances in my attacks;
perhaps I was, but haven't we won?  Libel suits don't
worry me.  We'll not press our own suits.  That Illinois
indictment against Armstrong came too late to do us any
good; let it be dismissed.  But wait&mdash;just wait!"
</p>

<p>
He leaned back, deliberately checking himself, not
wishing to reveal too much of his inner feeling to this
confederate of his.  His usual suave calmness returned to
him.
</p>

<p>
Findlater nervously cleared his throat.  He had not
missed that quick, vindictive snarl.  During the past few
weeks he had become much better acquainted with Macgowan
than ever before; and in his heart he had grown
terribly afraid of the man, having learned with what
reckless and even criminal audacity Macgowan could act.
He now realized that he himself had been drawn slowly
but surely into the meshes of a net, the drawstrings of
which lay in the powerful grip of Macgowan.
</p>

<p>
Now, in his cowardice, he made an effort to change the
subject&mdash;only to find that it drove back again upon him
with new insistence.
</p>

<p>
"Something else I wanted to ask you, Mac.  There's a
check on my desk to be counter-signed&mdash;five thousand
dollars to a man named Slosson.  I can't locate the record
of any transaction&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Macgowan cut in blandly, with all his suave poise to
the fore.
</p>

<p>
"It's quite correct, I assure you.  The check goes to
him for&mdash;shall we say, legal services?
</p>

<p>
"Slosson," went on Macgowan, "has executed a slight
commission for which Consolidated can well afford to pay.
He is a partner of our friend Ried Williams, by the way,
and is waiting to get this check before returning to
Indianapolis.  If all goes as I expect, we shall issue
checks in a similar amount both to Williams and Slosson,
within a few more days.  Perhaps at once."
</p>

<p>
This was all news to Findlater, and inwardly it
infuriated him to perceive that Macgowan was handling
funds and making plans without a word of consultation.
</p>

<p>
"I'd like to know more about this," he said aggressively.
</p>

<p>
"Of course!  Did you ever hear of a gentleman named
Windsor?"
</p>

<p>
Findlater shook his head.  "Who is he?"
</p>

<p>
"Assistant attorney general of Indiana," said Macgowan
smoothly.  "At present he is a special investigator,
appointed to probe into something connected with the
Food Products stock that Armstrong marketed.  Somehow,
word of something rotten about this stock issue
reached him&mdash;unfortunately, I can't explain the entire
matter just now.  I assure you, however, that the checks
going to Slosson and Williams have been well earned."
</p>

<p>
Findlater made an angry, irritated gesture.
</p>

<p>
"This pouring out money by the thousands is sheer
waste," he exclaimed heatedly.  "You've admitted that
the Illinois indictment amounts to nothing, that we'll not
press any of the suits we've filed.  Then why the devil are
you spending all this money to get an Indiana indictment
on the same grounds?"
</p>

<p>
"Ah, but I'm not!"  Macgowan chuckled amusedly.
"On materially different grounds, my dear chap.  This
Mr. Windsor is a man who cannot be bribed or coerced,
a man whose acumen is keen, whose integrity is as Cæsar's
wife."
</p>

<p>
He paused and surveyed Findlater blandly.
</p>

<p>
"Such a man becomes an invaluable tool in the proper
hand.  I may inform you that he will not only indict
Armstrong, but will convict him.  He is now collecting
the proofs, and upon his return to Indiana, he will send
Armstrong to prison."
</p>

<p>
"What have you found against Armstrong, anyway?"
</p>

<p>
"That remains a secret in which I have no concern,"
responded Macgowan cheerfully.  "A secret which is
supposedly locked within the breast of Mr. Windsor and
one or two&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Damn it, why can't you come into the open with me?"
exploded Findlater.
</p>

<p>
"I shall, presently." For an instant the gleam in
Macgowan's eyes was wolfish.  "Since you have demanded
my program, I am presenting it.  Armstrong will be
indicted, tried, and convicted; this is certain.  He is
already ruined in his home, with his wife departed.  He
will be a broken man.  The Armstrong Company will go
to pieces with him.  The fight being waged against us will
die of inertia.  This is inevitable."
</p>

<p>
Macgowan puffed his cigar alight, then went on.
</p>

<p>
"You see, then, why I am not concerned over these legal
affairs?  The suits against us will hardly be pressed, with
Armstrong a convict.  Our own suits we calmly dismiss."
</p>

<p>
"But are you sure of convicting him?" asked Findlater,
a glow of hope in his eyes.
</p>

<p>
Macgowan smiled cynically.  "I prepared the evidence
myself.  Need I say more?"
</p>

<p>
Findlater leaned back and drew a long breath.  At this
moment, however, Macgowan changed the subject.  He
regarded Findlater with latent cruelty, a steady appraisal
which showed how absolutely he held the other man in his
power.
</p>

<p>
"There is a little matter which you and I must settle,"
he said.  His tone made the other man jerk around.
"Suppose you affix your signature to this."
</p>

<p>
He held out the typed document which lay before him.
</p>

<p>
Findlater took it, adjusted his glasses and glanced at
the paper.  He looked more attentively.  Slowly the color
faded out of his cheeks, and the paper shook in his hand.
He looked up, caught his breath.
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I don't understand!" he began.  The challenging
gaze of Macgowan seemed to sap the man's vitality.  His
voice failed.
</p>

<p>
"Can't you read?" asked Macgowan coldly.  "Your
resignation as president of Consolidated, undated; also, an
agreement empowering me to vote your control in the
voting trust.  It seems very simple."
</p>

<p>
Findlater rallied.  His countenance purpled with a rush
of anger.
</p>

<p>
"Damn you, Mac, you can't force me out&mdash;I'm not to
be bullied into walking out of here like Armstrong did!
If you think you'll stab me in the back, you can guess
again.  I know too much about you and how you've run
things&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You'll tell it, will you?" cut in Macgowan, chuckling.
</p>

<p>
Findlater glared at him, trembling with rage and fright.
Like a rat backed into a corner, one touch would either
lend him a devastating fury to fight at all costs, or would
send him scurrying away in blind panic.
</p>

<p>
Macgowan, watching him, applied the touch very deftly.
</p>

<p>
"I don't want to use that resignation now; it may never
be used.  As to talking, everything in the campaign has
been done over your name, as president, so talk all you
like, and I'll leave you to settle matters with the other
crowd.  And I will leave you, unless you sign.  Why
shouldn't I?  What about that proposition you made
Armstrong over in Wilmington?  All ready to sell me out,
weren't you!  And you thought I'd never know it."
</p>

<p>
At this, Findlater turned white again.  Macgowan
laughed thinly.
</p>

<p>
"I'll take no more chances on you, Henry C. Findlater!
From now on, you'll be in my pocket, under my hand&mdash;or
else I'll walk out of here and give a statement to the press
that will wake things up!  Who issued those ten thousand
shares to Williams?  You did."
</p>

<p>
"At your orders!" cried Findlater wildly.  "It was you
who did everything!"
</p>

<p>
"Prove it."  Macgowan, abruptly, flamed with arrogance
and tumultuous violence.  His fist crashed on
the desk as he leaned forward and transfixed Findlater
with his wolfish, menacing stare.
</p>

<p>
"Sign that paper and get out of here!" he roared.
"Throw me over, will you?  I'll show you where you
get off, you dirty hound!  We'll have this paper signed
and witnessed, and if you ever again try to knife
me&mdash;Lord help you!  Get busy!"
</p>

<p>
Findlater, his brow streaming with perspiration, laid
the paper on the desk and reached out trembling fingers
for a pen.

<h3>
CHAPTER II
</h3>

<p>
Jimmy Wren looked with harassed eyes at Armstrong,
who sat at his desk listlessly going over a
report.
</p>

<p>
"Reese," he broke out impulsively, "what the devil can
I do?  How can I help?"
</p>

<p>
Armstrong looked up at him soberly.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing, Jimmy, thanks," he answered in a flat voice.
</p>

<p>
"You've not heard from Dorothy?"
</p>

<p>
Armstrong shook his head.  "No.  She's in Evansville,
and has opened her father's house there, I understand."
</p>

<p>
Jimmy Wren was aware only of the troubled fact, and
not of the details that lay behind Dorothy's desertion.
Armstrong had closed Aircastle Point the day after she
left, and was now in an uptown hotel.
</p>

<p>
Reese Armstrong was still bewildered, dazed, by this
private tragedy, which over-shadowed everything else.  He
could not spur himself to take any interest in the winding-up
of the campaign, and accepted without question what
was done by Holcomb and the others.  Dorothy had
returned no answer to his one implorant letter; this silence
hurt more deeply than her words.
</p>

<p>
A profound apathy was upon him.  Somehow, he felt,
Macgowan had been responsible for this final and crushing
blow; but how, he was at a loss to know.  His apathy was
continually pierced by the thought of going to Indianapolis
and wringing an explanation out of Slosson, yet he could
not stir himself to the action.  He had not the slightest
idea what Slosson had implanted in Dorothy's mind.  He
could not imagine why she had been so insistent upon his
guilt, how he had been so utterly damned in her eyes.
He must face Slosson with nothing but surmise&mdash;and the
heart was gone out of him.  He knew it, as did those
around him; but only Jimmy Wren knew that his domestic
separation was the cause of it all.
</p>

<p>
"Damn Slosson!" he burst forth despairingly.  "If I
had him here I'd choke the truth out of his&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He checked himself abruptly, with an effort.  Jimmy
Wren stared.
</p>

<p>
"Slosson!  The fellow on the old Food Products board?
Why, I met him in Evansville.  What's he got to do with
this, Reese?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, nothing, Jimmy, nothing I can go into!" groaned
Armstrong, flinging the paper in his hand across the desk.
"Don't ask me, old man.  It's hell, that's all."
</p>

<p>
He reached for a cigar and lighted it, biting hard on
the weed, his brow furrowed and lined by the stormy mood
within.
</p>

<p>
Armstrong had ceased to evince interest in the various
suits and legal activities; their issue or rather lack of
issue now mattered nothing to him.  What did matter was
Dorothy's accusation.  Upon what had she based her
arraignment?  She must have acted after deliberate
thought, with apparently firm grounds.  He could only lay
hold upon the obsession that he had robbed her father of
Food Products; any other surmise could only appear weak
and unsatisfactory.  He had been tempted to cable the
Demings to come home and help straighten the thing out&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Look here, Reese!" broke in the voice of Jimmy Wren
again.  Wren seated himself on one corner of the desk
and lowered his voice to a confidential pitch.  The warm
geniality of his features, however, was obviously an
attempt, an effort, and could not quite disguise the anxiety
in his eyes as he regarded Armstrong.
</p>

<p>
"If you're not doing anything to-night," he went on,
"s'pose you let me take you uptown and meet a friend
of mine, will you?  This is just between you and me,
Reese.  I'd like to have you meet her&mdash;haven't mentioned
it before, because we've all been so infernally balled up
with this campaign."
</p>

<p>
Armstrong smiled slightly at him.  "What, Jimmy!
Are you hooked at last?"
</p>

<p>
"Not yet, but I'd like to be!  You come along with me
to-night, Reese, and we'll have a bit of real music that'll
take the edge off your nerves.  Come on, now, will you?
Or wait&mdash;this is Saturday!  I'll call her up, and we may
run up there this afternoon, and all have dinner and a
show later on.  What say?"
</p>

<p>
Armstrong hesitated.  Although he was well enough
aware that this proposal was made to provide some
distraction for him, he knew that he needed the distraction.
Besides, he was curious about Jimmy Wren's very secret
love affair.
</p>

<p>
"You've kept quiet about her, Jimmy&mdash;why?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, she wanted me to," admitted Jimmy Wren,
reddening a bit.  "You see, she doesn't go in for gay life
and all that sploshy stuff&mdash;to tell the truth, she's given
me a lot of help these days&mdash;well, it's just that she
understands, see?  We're not engaged yet or anything like that;
she just lets me come around, and we have some music,
and talk.  You'd have to know her to understand, Reese."
</p>

<p>
Armstrong's lips twitched; this took him back to college
days.  He was upon the point of accepting Jimmy's
invitation, when the telephone rang.  He pulled forward the
instrument.
</p>

<p>
"Armstrong?  This is Todrank speaking."
</p>

<p>
Todrank was his banker, not a warm personal friend, but
a man of wide influence and connections.  His interest
in the fight on Findlater and Macgowan had been keen
and tense, because Todrank was a man who never relented
unto an enemy.  And, at some period in the past, Todrank
and Lawrence Macgowan had been bitter enemies.  Macgowan
might have, probably had, forgotten this fact, but
with Todrank there was no past tense.  If he liked
Armstrong, it was largely because he hated Macgowan.
</p>

<p>
"Do you know anything about Tom Windsor," he went
on, "assistant attorney general of Indiana?"
</p>

<p>
"No," said Armstrong.  "I think I've met him in
Evansville.  A tall, lean-jawed chap?"
</p>

<p>
"Yep.  He's a friend of mine; straight as a string and
can't be reached. He was in to see me yesterday.  Didn't
know that I knew you, and asked questions.  You'll regard
this as confidential?"
</p>

<p>
"Absolutely," returned Armstrong.  He made a gesture,
and Jimmy Wren closed the door.
</p>

<p>
"Didn't you market a stock issue of the Deming Food
Products Company, around the end of last year?"
</p>

<p>
"Most of the issue, yes.  It's a subsidiary of
Consolidated Securities.  Why?"
</p>

<p>
"Windsor intimated that there'd been something crooked
about that stock&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that's all old stuff," cut in Armstrong wearily.
"You know all about it.  Macgowan has tried to get
indictments&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Wake up, Armstrong!" snapped the banker curtly.
"This is something else again&mdash;something different!
Windsor swears that Macgowan has nothing to do with
it&mdash;doesn't even know Mac by sight.  Get this man right,
or you'll make the mistake of your life!  He's so straight
that he'll fall over backward some day.  And he's hot on
your trail."
</p>

<p>
Armstrong's curiosity was slightly stirred, no more.
</p>

<p>
"Let him go as far as he likes.  I've nothing to hide.
He can come around here and go through the books if he
likes."
</p>

<p>
Todrank uttered a disgusted oath.
</p>

<p>
"Damn it, that's just what he won't do!  That's why
I'm trying to warn you!  He isn't going, either&mdash;he's
gone!  He appears to have a hatful of the most damning
evidence against you.  I don't know what it is, but if Tom
Windsor thinks you're a crook&mdash;then look out.  He's
stubborn as the devil.  I believe that Macgowan is in it
somewhere, although Windsor laughed at the idea.  I gave him
the inside stuff on your fight, and he merely showed his
teeth.
</p>

<p>
"You wake up, now!" went on the banker earnestly.
"This is serious.  I gathered that the license to market
the stock was gained under false pretenses&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Armstrong was stirred at last.  "That was arranged by
the former company.  I only took over the issue and
marketed it."
</p>

<p>
"Well, there's a nigger in the woodpile somewhere.
Windsor thinks you're the nigger; I'm suspecting
Macgowan of some hidden stuff.  This is no fake, now; you
can't afford to let it go through.  If Windsor once gets
action in the courts, he'll shove till hell freezes over,
because he's absolutely honest.  He's a fanatic in this respect,
the most dangerous sort!  He's got the goods, or he'd
never talk as he did to me."
</p>

<p>
"Why, confound it," burst out Armstrong, roused at
last, "it's rankly impossible that he could have anything
on me!"
</p>

<p>
"You fool, don't you know Macgowan yet?" roared the
banker angrily.  "Listen here!  Windsor mentioned another
thing.  He's been offered a ten-thousand-dollar job
here in town, with the firm of Milligan, Milligan, Hoyt &amp;
Brainard; a corporation law firm, fair to middling but
nothing extra.  The opening takes effect in about four
months; it came to him through Western sources entirely.
Personally, I smell Macgowan in the whole game.  So far
as I know, though, that firm has no connection with Mac,
so it's a wild guess."
</p>

<p>
"Where can I get in touch with Windsor?" said
Armstrong.
</p>

<p>
Todrank laughed.  The laugh was hard, sharp.
</p>

<p>
"You'll have your job cut out to get in touch with
him!  That lad wants facts, not personalities.  He figures
that the whole crowd of you are a gang of cut-throat
financial crooks, and wants to keep away from you."
</p>

<p>
"But it's absurd!" cried Armstrong.
</p>

<p>
"Sure.  Our jail system is absurd too, but the fact
doesn't empty Sing Sing," came the caustic reply.  "You
act, and act quick!  I know Tom Windsor, and he's the
only and original leader of the bloodhound chorus, once he
gets after a crook.  And he really thinks you're one.
Don't mention my name to him."
</p>

<p>
"All right, Todrank, and many thanks.  Is Windsor in town?"
</p>

<p>
"He's at the Pennsylvania, or was.  No telling now;
he's a vigorous young devil."
</p>

<p>
"Good.  Thanks again."
</p>

<p>
"Good luck!"
</p>

<p>
Todrank rang off.
</p>

<p>
Armstrong began to pace up and down, wrestling with
this information.  He found himself lifted out of his
lethargy, found the old hot anger running and leaping again,
found the apathetic and muffling impotency stripped
suddenly away.  The very mystery of this new blow roused
him to fight.  In what way could he be reached for any
illicit operation of Food Products?  He knew of none; yet
Todrank had supplied the hint, and he knew better than
to disregard the warning.  He turned, and found Jimmy
Wren staring at him from the corner.  Abruptly, memory
wakened within him.
</p>

<p>
"Say, Jimmy&mdash;why, what's the matter?"
</p>

<p>
Wren laughed aloud.  "Nothing, only you look waked
up!  Good news?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  More bad news.  That party for this afternoon
is all off, Jimmy; thanks just the same.  Do you remember
when you came to Evansville, the day before Christmas?"
</p>

<p>
"You bet I do," said Wren, blinking.
</p>

<p>
"You told me about an irregularity in the issue of Food
Products stock.  What was it?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, the Deming directors could never have marketed
that stock issue under the blue sky laws if they'd revealed
the actual condition of the company.  They falsified it."
</p>

<p>
Armstrong nodded.  "Yes, that's what I remember.  It
was all their doing?  It had no connection with us at
all?"
</p>

<p>
"Not a shadow," said Wren confidently.  "Not even
Macgowan could make that stick on us."
</p>

<p>
"So Mansfield said.  He should know.  I'll call him up&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"He's in Albany."
</p>

<p>
"Judge Holcomb around?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Well, you keep quiet about this." Armstrong rose.
"It may all come to nothing, as usual."
</p>

<p>
He went to the office used by the committee of the
Protective Association, where he found Judge Holcomb.  The
latter gave Armstrong a keen glance, and smiled.
</p>

<p>
"Congratulations, my boy!  You look yourself&mdash;got
your fighting clothes on again?"
</p>

<p>
"Lord, I must have been moping around here like a wet
hen!  Judge, I'm trying to run down something.  Did
you ever hear of a downtown law firm by the name of
Milligan, Milligan, Hoyt &amp; Brainard?"
</p>

<p>
The old judge leaned back.
</p>

<p>
"Did I ever hear of them?  I did, to my sorrow.
Haven't I ever told you about the time that Macgowan's
law firm hooked me hard and fast?"
</p>

<p>
Armstrong thrilled suddenly.  "But that firm isn't
his&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"That firm," said Judge Holcomb with decision, "is the
one that handled my case for me.  On the other side of the
case was Macgowan's firm.  And Macgowan was a very
silent but active partner in Milligan et cetera!  Oh, yes,
they hooked me."
</p>

<p>
"Can you prove that statement?" demanded Armstrong
sharply.
</p>

<p>
"I cannot.  As we know to our cost, any one who can
obtain definite evidence against Lawrence Macgowan is
a miracle worker.  Still, a number of attorneys are
convinced of the fact."
</p>

<p>
"All right, thanks." Armstrong nodded and rose.  "I
may see you later about it."
</p>

<p>
Returning to his own office, he summoned his secretary.
Already a keen exultation was thrilling inside of him;
already he felt that at last he was going to score a point
against Macgowan.  This Windsor would never suspect
that he was being bribed, that Macgowan had any connection
with the legal firm offering him a job.  Armstrong
accepted Todrank's estimate of Windsor implicitly,
knowing that it would be accurate.
</p>

<p>
He gave his secretary Windsor's name and asked her to
call him at the Pennsylvania and make an appointment
for that afternoon.  She left on her errand.  Armstrong
sat for a space in silence, eagerly awaiting a call.  None
came.  Presently the secretary returned.
</p>

<p>
"Did you get him?"
</p>

<p>
She hesitated.  "I&mdash;yes, I got him, but&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Well?"
</p>

<p>
"He said that he was leaving for Indianapolis in half an
hour and had no time for&mdash;for crooks.  He said the only
appointment he would make with you was before a Federal
judge, and that he'd make this appointment in his own
good time.  I'm sorry, sir&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Never mind."  Armstrong shrugged.  "Get Mr. Dorns
on the wire if you can."
</p>

<p>
He reflected rapidly.  The situation was undoubtedly
serious.  Windsor would never have given such a message
unless he had some incriminatory evidence&mdash;yet what could
he have?
</p>

<p>
The telephone rang.  Armstrong picked up the receiver.
</p>

<p>
"Hello, Dorns?  Oh, pretty well, thanks!  Something
very important has just come up.  I must get to Indianapolis
Monday morning sure&mdash;I'll catch a late train to-night.
When I get there I'll want help.  Can you put me
in touch with your agent there?"
</p>

<p>
"Better'n that," responded Dorns quickly.  "I've got
to be in Chicago next Saturday.  I can spare a few days
in Indianapolis.  But can't you catch that train at five
this afternoon?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Good.  That gives us a clear night's sleep in a bed
before Monday wakes up.  Same old fight, is it?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, only something new this time.  A fighting chance
to put the enemy down and out.  Bully for you, Dorns!
I'll get that five o'clock train."
</p>

<p>
"All right.  You get the reservations&mdash;I'll meet you at
the gate five minutes before the train goes.  I'm busy.  So
long."
</p>

<p>
Armstrong turned from the telephone.  The thought of
Dorothy leaped into his mind with a swiftly searching
pang; he could not conquer it.  After all, Indianapolis
was so close to Evansville!  He had no definite reason for
seeing Tom Windsor, other than to demand a hearing.
Perhaps, despite warnings, he would not have bothered
about going except that&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Maybe I'm a fool," he thought moodily.  "I wonder
if I've let this Windsor menace impress me too strongly&mdash;because
of Evansville?  It's not too late to change my
mind&mdash;no, I'll go!"
</p>

<p>
It did not occur to him that this urge and pull of spiritual
forces, this compellant thought of Dorothy, might have
any connection with practical things.  Men are slow to
believe in guardian angels.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER III
</h3>

<p>
Late in the afternoon of that same Saturday that
saw Armstrong's departure for Indianapolis, the
same Saturday that saw Findlater placed completely
in the power of Lawrence Macgowan, Jimmy Wren
called to see Mrs. Bird Fowler.  The call was unheralded
and purely on impulse, for Wren was harassed and at his
wits' end to serve Armstrong; the latter had not confided
in him about Todrank's warning, but Jimmy Wren had
guessed the purport from what Armstrong had said.  He
was worried and nervous.
</p>

<p>
Wren was sent up to the apartment and was received by
the maid, who knew that he was a favored visitor.
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Fowler is out, sir," she told him, "but I'm
expecting her back at any minute now.  I know she'd not
want to miss you.  If you'd care to wait&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Why, thanks, I will," said Jimmy Wren gratefully.
</p>

<p>
"Would you care for a fire, or tea&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"No, nothing, until Mrs. Fowler comes," he rejoined,
handing over his things.  "I'll just sit around and
smoke."
</p>

<p>
"Make yourself at home, sir.  If you want anything,
I'll be in the kitchen."
</p>

<p>
Jimmy Wren made his way to the cushioned window-seat,
and with a sigh of relaxation settled down with a
cigar.  Mrs. Fowler's apartment was on the second floor,
the windows overlooking the flashing street below, and the
cool green distances of Central Park across the way were
just emerging into the virginal glow of springtime.
</p>

<p>
The restful quiet of the room soothed Jimmy Wren's
nerves; the silence, the sense of being at home, were
grateful in the extreme.  He watched the slithering motors in
the street below, the glint of water and the thronging
people in the park opposite, and felt himself gradually return
to normal.  Presently Mrs. Fowler would come, and a bit of
music, a little sympathetic talk, would clear the blues from
his mind.
</p>

<p>
After a bit he rose, abandoned his occupation, and
began to walk about the room, seeking something to divert
his thoughts.  In one corner stood Mrs. Fowler's desk.
It was open, and the noon edition of a paper lay upon
it, an inkwell weighting down the newspaper.  Pausing
idly beside the desk, never thinking that the newspaper
might have been so placed designedly, Jimmy Wren removed
it and opened it out, glancing through the columns
and scanning the headlines with careless gaze.
</p>

<p>
Then he turned and put down the paper&mdash;and as he did
so, observed two objects over which it had originally been
laid.  One of these objects was a check; the other was
an unsigned note.
</p>

<p>
Jimmy Wren stared down, absolutely petrified by the
thing he saw, his eyes widening in fearful and terrible
comprehension.  For a long moment the written words did
not penetrate to his consciousness.  It was only the
handwriting that he saw, the handwriting that smote into him
with an actual physical shock, blinding him to everything
but the staggering realization of its presence here on
Mrs. Fowler's desk.
</p>

<p>
No one who had ever seen it could forget that bold,
angular, masterful handwriting of Lawrence Macgowan.
</p>

<p>
Wren wet his lips, swallowed hard, stunned beyond any
swift recovery.  Mrs. Fowler did not know Macgowan,
except very slightly indeed, and certainly had no use
whatever for the man; indeed, Wren had very often discussed
Macgowan's acts and schemes with her, feeling a sympathy
and comprehension on her part which was very grateful.
Her detestation of Macgowan's type of man was intense.
</p>

<p>
Then, why this letter&mdash;this communication with Macgowan?
</p>

<p>
Startled, angered, a flood of horrible suspicion searing
into his soul, Jimmy Wren reached down and picked up
that sheet of notepaper bearing the few lines of writing.
Not until then did the words achieve impact upon his
brain, but now that impact came with astounding and
terrific force:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Dear Viola: Herewith a check in the usual form, on account.
During the next few days I want the fullest possible
information.  Then we'll hold that party of celebration."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Wren replaced the note, and let his eyes drop to the
check.  It did not bear Macgowan's name, and the
signature was wholly strange to Wren.
</p>

<p>
After a moment he drew a quick breath, looked down at
the desk, replaced the newspaper and weight as they had
been originally, then turned and walked to the window-seat.
There he sank down, staring out at the street and
park beyond.
</p>

<p>
His brain was at work now, dreadfully at work.  Viola!
So Macgowan knew her by that other name, the same name
Dorothy Armstrong had used.  Viola Bland!  And what
information did Macgowan want&mdash;how long had Mrs. Fowler
been collecting information for Macgowan?  A little
shiver passed through Wren's body.  He remembered now
about his flight to Tampa, and putting two and two
together, began to form an unescapable certainty.
</p>

<p>
Presently he took off his black-rimmed glasses and
polished them methodically.  Fiery and impulsive as Jimmy
Wren was, in a moment of crisis he was anything but
emotional.  The blow was sudden and severe, staggering him
and sending all his scheme of things into reeling chaos; yet
it was not in him to take it with any hysterical whirlwind
of outward display.  Instead, as he came to cold realization
of the truth, all the acute perception of his character
was wakened and rallied to face the situation.
</p>

<p>
The hurt was there, and it was deep, but not so deep as
Jimmy Wren thought with the first blaze of pain.  His
quick, sharp wakening was proof sufficient of this.  In
Macgowan's handwriting he was given a broadly comprehensive
vision of Mrs. Fowler to which he could not blind
himself.  Nor did he doubt or quibble for an instant.  The
feeling which he had taken for love was wrenched out of
him with fearful abruptness, but no vacuum remained.
</p>

<p>
Fright deadened the force and the pain of it; a horrified
fright, as the man comprehended what had been going on
during these weeks and months of the campaign against
Macgowan.  All this while, Armstrong's right-hand man
had been confiding everything in his heart, hopes and fears
and plans, to the ear of a hired spy.  That was the cold
fact of it.
</p>

<p>
"By golly, but I've been a fool!" murmured Wren abjectly.
"To think that she'd do me that way&mdash;why, she's
lied like a Trojan to me!"
</p>

<p>
Suddenly he reacted; it was characteristic of him.
Another man might have pondered his folly, mourned the
consequences of his blindness.  Jimmy Wren was abruptly
stirred to sanity, to a cold anger, to a keen lust of fight.
His one thought now was how best he could strike back,
repay this blow, use this bitter knowledge to repair the
damage he must have unwillingly caused Armstrong.
</p>

<p>
Face Mrs. Fowler down?  No.  To let the enemy know
they were discovered, would effect nothing.  Outwardly
cool, inwardly a seething mass of activity, Jimmy Wren
decided upon that keynote of caution&mdash;and then leaned
forward, his attention drawn by a taxicab which had just
pulled up at the curb below his window.  A man alighted
and assisted his companion out; his companion was
Mrs. Fowler.
</p>

<p>
But the man&mdash;the man himself!  Jimmy Wren's eyes
blazed as he craned forward, unable to recognize the
figure, as the two below him stood a moment in talk.  Then
the man doffed his hat, and a low whistle broke from
Wren.  He had not seen that face in long months, yet he
knew it again at sight, knew it and thought of Armstrong's
deadly trouble.  Pete Slosson!
</p>

<p>
"What the devil have I stumbled upon, anyhow?"
muttered Wren, as he hastily drew back from the window.
"Here's a connection between Slosson, the lady, and
Macgowan&mdash;but what's the connection?  Damned if I can see
any.  A fine fool, I am!  If I'd trusted Mrs. Armstrong
enough to&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He started, and a slow smile came to his lips.  Dorothy
Armstrong!  Somehow, Slosson was connected with the
private trouble of the Armstrongs; just how, he did not
know.  But Dorothy would know.  Here was the weapon
laid ready to his hand, could he but use it!
</p>

<p>
"By the gods, I'll use it, too!" he exclaimed to himself,
flaming at the thought.  "Reese has gone West.  I'll beat
it to Evansville and make a clean breast of the whole thing
to Dorothy; got to do that, now.  Whatever the reason
she left Reese, this business will throw some light on it,
I'll bet.  How did Slosson come to know Mrs. Fowler,
anyhow?  Why, Macgowan put him next, that's all.  And
it was Lorenz, Mac's friend, who introduced me&mdash;well, I'm
getting a line on this thing, right enough!"
</p>

<p>
The apartment door opened and closed again.
</p>

<p>
When Mrs. Fowler stepped into the room, Jimmy Wren
was puffing away at a fresh cigar and making some notes
in a memorandum book, too absorbed to hear her entry.
She shot one swift glance at the desk, then came forward.
Wren was on his feet instantly, his face beaming with
surprise and delight.
</p>

<p>
"Hello&mdash;I didn't hear you come in!  May I stop and
talk to you for a moment?"
</p>

<p>
"My dear boy, I'm delighted!" she greeted him warmly.
"Why didn't you call up and I'd have been here?"
</p>

<p>
"I came in a rush, as usual," and Jimmy grinned as
he helped Mrs. Fowler doff her wraps, and handed them
to the maid.  "You see, I'm leaving town to-night for a
day or so, and I wanted to get a last glimpse of you before
going."
</p>

<p>
"Mercy!  You're not starting for the North Pole?"  Smiling,
the lady seated herself among the pillows of the
window-seat, and accepted the cigarette which Jimmy
procured for her.  "Thank you.  What's this sudden trip
about?  More business?"
</p>

<p>
"Nope," responded Jimmy Wren.  "An aunt of mine
is dying in Chicago, and I'll have to run out there and do
the decent thing.  Haven't seen the old lady for uncounted
years, but that doesn't matter.  Too bad I didn't get the
wire a few hours earlier.  I might have gone with Reese.
He's off this afternoon&mdash;gone to Chicago to look into some
bond issue they want him to take over."
</p>

<p>
Wren rattled all this off in a breath.  Mrs. Fowler
smiled.
</p>

<p>
"My, Jimmy, but I wish I had your eager vitality!
You seem to have more pep to-day than you've had in a
month!  Does the passing of an elderly relative always
affect you this way?"
</p>

<p>
Wren grinned, but took warning.  He shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"No, but the prospect of a change of scene probably is
responsible.  Things are in bad shape at the office, you
know.  Macgowan has completely won his fight, and Armstrong
has given up the battle entirely.  I'm glad to get
away from the gloom."
</p>

<p>
The lady's eyes gleamed, and the gleam was swiftly
hidden.
</p>

<p>
"Poor boy!" she commiserated softly.  "And you're so
devoted to Armstrong, too!  I do hope that things will
take a turn for the better from now on."
</p>

<p>
"They will," said Jimmy devoutly.  "Now that the
fight's over, even if we've been well beaten, we'll try to
take out the smart by going ahead with other things and
forgetting the defeat."
</p>

<p>
He knew better than to try and extract any information,
and contented himself with supplying as mendacious an
account as possible to be taken to Macgowan's ears.
Presently he glanced at his watch and rose, giving an
exclamation of dismay.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't dream how the time has gone&mdash;I'll have to
rush for it!  A thousand things to do yet!  If I'm back
Tuesday, may I see you?"
</p>

<p>
"The first minute you can, my dear Jimmy!"  Mrs. Fowler
rose and held out both hands to him warmly.
"Will the aunt leave you a fortune?"
</p>

<p>
"No chance," and Wren laughed with an amusement
that was unaffected.  "Nothing like that in our family,
I'm afraid!"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Fowler accompanied him to the door, and Jimmy
Wren congratulated himself upon a very graceful exit.
When the door had closed behind him and he was in the
elevator, he uttered a long sigh of relief.
</p>

<p>
"There's an extra fare train on the Pennsylvania to-night,"
he reflected.  "I can make it, connect at Terre
Haute, and get into Evansville to-morrow morning&mdash;good!
And I sure hope Mrs. Armstrong can make some sense
out of this affair&mdash;more, at least, than I can!  But
Slosson's the nigger in the woodpile, and maybe she can
pull him out.  Whew!  I've got some confessing to do
and no mistake!"
</p>

<p>
His smile was rueful at the thought.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
</h3>

<p>
Jimmy Wren made his train without difficulty that
evening.  He spent half an hour in the diner and
then made his way forward to the club car, anticipating
a smoke and an hour of talk before retiring.  To his
infinite disgust, he found the car crowded.
</p>

<p>
As he stood beside the magazine rack and scanned the
smoke-filled body of the car, he was suddenly aware that
most of the men were amusedly watching one of their
number&mdash;and Jimmy Wren, following the general gaze,
found himself looking at the flushed features of Pete
Slosson.
</p>

<p>
Obviously having ordered innocuous drinks for himself
and a protesting fellow-traveler, Slosson was putting into
the drinks a heavy "stick" from a large pocket-flask.
It was his maudlin ostentation that had drawn all eyes,
in tolerant amusement, for he was flourishing the flask
and delivering a general address upon prohibition, while
inviting all and sundry to join his libations.
</p>

<p>
Uttering a grunt of contempt, Jimmy Wren turned and
retraced his steps to the rear of the train.  Gaining the
observation platform, he found himself alone, and settled
down in a corner chair.  He lighted his cigar and stared
out into the night across the rails that flashed in the track
of the train.
</p>

<p>
"Confound the fellow!" 'he thought angrily.  "Confound
the luck that brought me on the same train with him!"
</p>

<p>
He removed his black-rimmed glasses, pocketed them,
and cursed the cinders and Slosson impartially.
</p>

<p>
In reality, Jimmy Wren meant his oaths to apply
liberally to himself; his folly was magnified in his own
eyes.  There was no telling how much harm his intimacy
with Mrs. Fowler had done Armstrong's cause in the past
few weeks; and now that he had to sit here inactively and
think about it, he was tormented anew.
</p>

<p>
Again, that glimpse of Pete Slosson revived in his mind
the memory of how he had looked from the window to see
Slosson bring Mrs. Fowler home.  All tenderness and fond
imaginings had been ripped out of Wren's soul at one
quick wrench, yet the hurt was there.  Unable to vent his
anger on the lady in the case, he scowled blackly at thought
of Slosson's vaguely-guessed hand in all this game, and
cursed himself for a fool.
</p>

<p>
Jimmy tossed away his cigar and produced another one.
As he was lighting it within cupped hands, the car door
opened and another man came out beneath the dome light
of the observation platform.  In no mood for conversation,
Jimmy Wren did not glance at him.
</p>

<p>
"Hell of a conductor on this train!" said the other,
with voice uplifted above the roar.  "Hell of a conductor,
that's all I've got to say!  Idea of tellin' me to go to bed
an' behave myself!"
</p>

<p>
Jimmy Wren looked up.  Slosson stood there, swaying
unsteadily to the swinging lurch of the train, trying to
extract his flask from his hip-pocket.  As he labored,
Slosson looked down at Wren, but entirely without recognition.
The absence of Wren's usual glasses, and the light
from directly above, combined with Slosson's befogged
condition to render him entirely oblivious of the identity
of the person whom he now addressed.
</p>

<p>
"Ain't that the limit, I'm asking you?  What right's a
conductor got to put passenger out o' the  club car, eh?
I've paid my fare and I'm 'titled to ride where I like.
You see what happens when I write in to the company
about this, that's all!  Here, have a li'l drink?  Don't be
'fraid; no white mule in this, brother."
</p>

<p>
"To hell with you," snapped Jimmy Wren, and turned
his shoulder to the intruder.  He saw that he was
unrecognized, and was glad of the fact.  None the less, his
temper was hot and at the surface.
</p>

<p>
Slosson uttered a propitiatory laugh.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it's all right!  Bonded stuff, I'm tellin' you,
brother!  Go far's you like; more where this comes from.
Can't fool me on liquor, you bet!  Here, take a li'l sample,
just to prove you'n me&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He thrust the flask under Wren's nose.  Irritated beyond
endurance, Wren angrily struck it aside; there came
a shivering crash of glass and an odor of raw whisky as
the flask shivered on the brass guard-rail.
</p>

<p>
"Hey!" cried Slosson's indignant voice.  "Now look
what you've done!  What's matter with you, eh?"
</p>

<p>
His hand clamped down suddenly on Wren's shoulder.
Wren took the cigar from his mouth and shoved the
glowing end into Slosson's hand.
</p>

<p>
"Get to hell out of here," he snarled.
</p>

<p>
A howl of agony burst from Slosson, then his fist drove
into Wren's face and sent him sprawling.  A long train
of sparks flew out into the night from the cigar as it
shivered; the train clattered over a crossing and the brakes
screeched slightly, slowing down for a stop at a large
town ahead.
</p>

<p>
To everything except each other, the two men on the
observation platform were blinded.
</p>

<p>
Wren rose and hurled himself on Slosson, lashing out
in wildcat fury.  Every restraint was gone from him,
swept away by a whirlwind of rage; he forgot everything
except that detested face, and slammed his fists into it
frantically.
</p>

<p>
It was well for Jimmy Wren that Slosson's muddled
brain could not exert its usual keen cunning.  Aghast
before the unexpected passion of this attack, Slosson was
slow to answer it in kind, until the sting and batter of
Wren's blows hammering into his face roused him to
response.  Then, bearing forward with a storm of oaths, he
beat back the more slender figure of Wren, his arms
working like piston-rods.  Both men were too beside
themselves to hit vitally for the body; they struck only for
the face, for punishment, insensate with mutual madness
and battle-fever.
</p>

<p>
Wren had the worse of this slugging-match.  Backed
into a corner of the guard-rail, he received terrific
punishment&mdash;until he seized an opening and got in a whip-crack
blow to the mouth whose impact staggered Slosson.  Enraged
afresh, the latter flung himself bodily at Wren; the
two men clinched, and went reeling back and forth across
the narrow platform to the lurches of the train.
</p>

<p>
Slosson, panting forth curses, got his fingers locked about
Wren's throat, and the latter tried desperately but vainly
to free himself of that death-grip.  One of the folding
chairs tripped them both.  The train swung sharply; for
an instant Wren felt the brass rail at his back&mdash;then he
was over, falling into the night, and Slosson with him.
A crash, the keen edge of cutting gravel in his face, and
Wren found the hold upon his throat loosened as they
struck and rolled over together.
</p>

<p>
The train went thundering on.
</p>

<p>
After a moment Wren pulled himself to hands and knees,
dazed by the shock, and stared about.  Dotting lights
showed him that he was in the precincts of a town; then,
with a low exclamation, he drew himself to where Slosson
lay motionless under the stars.
</p>

<p>
"Stunned&mdash;thank heaven he's not dead!" murmured
Wren.  "Why both of us weren't killed, is more than I
know&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The whistle of another train warned him that they were
yet in danger.  He stooped, dragged Slosson's inert figure
down the embankment, and then relaxed, panting.  A
brief examination served to show that he was badly bruised
and knocked about, a mass of cuts and scratches, but
sound in wind and limb.  His quick wits took stock of the
situation.
</p>

<p>
"Hm!  Nobody saw that scrap," he reflected swiftly.
"They'll think we got left at this station or some other
one, when they find we're gone.  Well, I sure bit off more
than I could chew this time&mdash;if we hadn't gone over, that
devil would have choked the life out of me!"
</p>

<p>
He bent over Slosson again, and this time made a more
careful search.  He could find no serious injury, and as he
worked, Slosson's stertorous breathing became regular and
deep.  The man's coma had passed into a drunken sleep.
</p>

<p>
Jimmy Wren laughed softly.  He removed Slosson's
coat, emptied it of everything, and then rolled it up and
put it under the head of its owner.  Stiff and sore, he
dragged himself to his feet.
</p>

<p>
"Sleep hearty!" he admonished his unconscious enemy.
"And if I ever hit you again, it'll be with a crowbar&mdash;'and
let no mournful yesterdays disturb thy peaceful
heart!'  Pleasant dreams."
</p>

<p>
Gaining the track, he took up his slow and painful way
toward the town.

<h3>
CHAPTER V
</h3>

<p>
Tom Windsor reached Indianapolis on Sunday,
spent a few hours with his family, and the same
evening boarded a train for Evansville.  It was
the same train from which Armstrong and Robert Dorns
alighted.  Windsor's business in Evansville was slight
but highly important.
</p>

<p>
One who knew the reputation of Tom Windsor, would
have visualized an altogether different type of man.  He
possessed a long, hard jaw; no mistake about that!  For
the rest, his appearance gave no indication of undue
rigidity; quite the contrary, in fact.  His cheerful smile
was much in evidence, and he wore an air of alert
optimism.  He was a man of many friends, always in
demand as a speaker at Rotarian or "uplift" banquets, and
shared with Will Ross the distinction of being the most
popular pall-bearer in southern Indiana.
</p>

<p>
Reaching Evansville toward noon, Windsor took his way
at once to the hotel where he had a particular errand.  He
had relatives in Evansville, but was seeing no one this trip.
He was keenly on the scent of the final bit of evidence that
he desired to establish his case against Armstrong.  In this
case he was entirely ready to suspect anything and every
one, particularly after learning in New York what a
network of intrigue underlay the Armstrong-Macgowan battle.
Windsor intended to be nobody's tool.
</p>

<p>
He went direct to the office of the hotel manager, whom
he knew very well personally.  He met with an uproarious
welcome, and an offer of a quart of rye.  All roads led
to the river towns, from the earliest days of prohibition in
the state.
</p>

<p>
Windsor waved aside the offer with his usual smile.
</p>

<p>
"Judge Sanderson'll get you yet, Norman, and up
you'll go!  But to-day I want another sort of favor.  I'm
going to lunch in your esteemed hostelry, and my time is
short&mdash;I want the next train back to Indianapolis.  While
I'm lunching, will you look up your registers for last
July?  I believe a man named Wren was here, between
the first and fifteenth, and I must verify the fact."
</p>

<p>
"Sure thing!" was the hearty response.  "Everything
in the house except the cellar is at the service of the law!
I'll have the evidence waiting for you after lunch."
</p>

<p>
Windsor promptly repaired to the dining room.  As
soon as luncheon was over, he found the manager as good
as his word.  With keen satisfaction he discovered that
Jimmy Wren had been here during the second week in.
July, and he carried away with him the loose-leaf page of
the register which confirmed the fact.  The final link in
his chain of evidence was complete.
</p>

<p>
He left the hotel, meaning to get a taxicab at the corner
and spend his remaining half-hour in the city making a
quick round of his relatives.  As he came to the curb, he
paused and turned.  A passing car had swerved in
suddenly, and he heard his name called.  The chauffeur
gestured to him.
</p>

<p>
Windsor stepped forward.  The sedan door opened, and
he found himself facing Dorothy Armstrong.  She was
leaning forward eagerly, her hand extended; and the
startling change in her appearance since his last view of
her, astonished and alarmed Windsor.  He shook hands
heartily, yet with the fervent inward wish that he were
elsewhere.  She could not know of the case on which he
was working, yet&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Get in, Tom, and I'll take you wherever you're going,"
Dorothy was saying.  "There's something I want very
much to ask you about.  No, keep your cigar&mdash;I adore
it, and you always picked such good ones!"
</p>

<p>
Windsor was caught off guard, and for once his ready
brain failed him.  He meekly entered the sedan,
murmuring that he was on his way to the station.
</p>

<p>
"Then we can have a little talk," said Dorothy.
"You're looking splendid, Tom, and I hear such fine
things about you!  Tell me&mdash;is it true that you're
working on a case that involves Mr. Armstrong?"
</p>

<p>
For one instant Windsor was staggered, panic-stricken;
even to the average eye Dorothy's condition was evident,
and he hesitated whether to lie or tell the truth.  Then
he rallied, squared himself to meet pleas and protests,
and the gaze that he turned to Dorothy was keenly
alert.
</p>

<p>
"I can't discuss the matter, Dot," he said quietly.
"I'm sorry, but&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Now, Tom, please don't be silly!"  Her calm look
disquieted him to a singular degree.  "You have already
answered my question.  When I was in New York, I heard
that you were about to involve Reese in some business
matter, and I'm not going to ask you to discuss it in any
way.  But it's providential that we met, because there's
something I want to ask you.  And I'm not going to
defend Reese or stand up for him."
</p>

<p>
Windsor could find no response, and waited.  He was
acutely embarrassed, but he was thoroughly on the alert.
Dorothy's next words startled him afresh.
</p>

<p>
"Do you know anything about the business fight between
Reese and a man named Macgowan?"
</p>

<p>
"Something," returned Windsor cautiously.  The car
was driving slowly along Main Street toward the
railroad station, and he wished most heartily that it would
quicken pace.
</p>

<p>
"Well," Dorothy spoke with an air of seeking exact
words to express her thought, "for a long time I have
known that Macgowan was seeking in every underhand way
to hurt Reese, even in ways of which Reese knows nothing.
Macgowan's a very clever man, Tom.  I should like to
ask you&mdash;and I think you can answer the question
fairly&mdash;whether this present matter came to your ears, in any
possible way, through or from Macgowan?"
</p>

<p>
Windsor considered this question a moment.  He could
discern no trap, and made up his mind to accept Dorothy's
words at their face value.  He turned to her.
</p>

<p>
"I understand what you're driving at, Dot," he
answered quietly.  "I'll be frank.  Had it come to me
through Macgowan, I'd have distrusted the whole thing,
although I've never seen the man himself.  But the affair
came to me directly from two small investors in Food
Products stock, who wrote in to the office about it."
</p>

<p>
"Couldn't Macgowan have prompted them to write?"
she demanded sharply.
</p>

<p>
"Of course."  Windsor nodded.  "But they had nothing
to do with the&mdash;the actual crime that was committed, Dot.
I have traced that independent of any one else.  The
stock of this company was placed on the market in a
fraudulent manner, that's all.  I have absolute evidence
that it was done by your husband.  I'm sorry to say this;
it's hard for me&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Never mind, Tom.  I know you're only doing your
duty, and I'm not trying to argue the point.  It had,
however, more than once occurred to me that behind
this there might be the hand of Macgowan, and I meant
to write you about the possibility.  If there were any
least connection with that man&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I get you," he said with a curt nod.  "There is
absolutely none!  I've gone over everything very carefully
to avoid that possibility, in fact.  A relative of this
same Macgowan is involved&mdash;you know Ried Williams, of
course."
</p>

<p>
Dorothy caught her breath.
</p>

<p>
"Williams!  But he hates Reese, hates him bitterly!
And he's a cousin&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I know all that, Dot." Windsor smiled grimly.
"Don't think for a moment that Williams came forward
to tell what he knows!  On the contrary, I went after
Williams and forced him to a showdown; he's incriminated
in the affair himself, you see.  No, Dot, you may be sure
of one thing&mdash;I'm trying to be just.  I'm not letting any
one use me for a tool if I can help it."
</p>

<p>
"I know, Tom, I know," she responded, and sighed.
"Well, I suppose that's all.  I know you can't talk about
the case, and I don't want to hear about it.  But, Tom!
You'll be careful?  You will?  Not to let Macgowan reach
you in any way?"
</p>

<p>
Windsor laughed shortly.  "Do you think I'm easily
reached?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you know what I mean.  That man is so clever,
and he hates Reese so vindictively!  And he knows so well
how to hide himself behind other people."
</p>

<p>
Tom Windsor patted her hand as it lay beside him.
</p>

<p>
"My dear Dot, I read law, as they used to call it, under
old Judge Williamson&mdash;one of your father's best friends.
He used to say that the law was an institution for the
protection of honest men against rascals, but that the
rascals have turned it into a protection against honest
men.  I've remembered that saying, Dot, mighty often;
and as long as I have any connection with the practice of
law, I'll try to keep the institution in its original channels.
Well, I must say good-by&mdash;and I'm glad we've had this
little talk."
</p>

<p>
"So am I, Tom," said Dorothy simply.  He alighted
and said good-by, and as he turned into the station,
Dorothy ordered the car out into the country.
</p>

<p>
She wanted to get away from home, from town, from
every one she knew, out into the open air.  Her last hope,
faint and half-cherished as it was, had been destroyed by
this meeting with Windsor.  Only within the past few days
had the vague fancy arisen within her&mdash;that Macgowan
might somehow be connected with the charges against
Reese.  Now it was gone.  There remained only the bitter
hurt of her mortal wound.
</p>

<p>
She knew well enough what she must now expect of the
immediate future, and the thought sickened her.  Even the
sweet springtide all about her furthered the hurt; spring
in the world, and winter in her heart!
</p>

<p>
For her life ahead, Dorothy could make no plans, could
take no thought; it was bleak.  In another month her
parents would be home from Europe, and then something
could be settled, some decisive course of action taken.  She
remembered how, after the wedding, she had surprised
her father upon his knees, praying for her happiness;
and he cheated and robbed in that very moment by the
man she had just married!
</p>

<p>
It was hours later when Dorothy came home&mdash;to find
Jimmy Wren awaiting her.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VI
</h3>

<p>
Upon Monday morning Armstrong and Dorns
ascertained very speedily that Tom Windsor was
still out of the city.  His office reported that he
had come and gone, and was expected back again Tuesday
morning by latest.
</p>

<p>
Overnight, Dorns heard Armstrong's tale and strongly
commended the impulse to seek out Windsor.
</p>

<p>
"I've heard of this bird," said the detective musingly.
"He's all they say of him, and then some.  He's nobody's
fool, but it looks as though Macgowan had made a fool out
of him this time, with that ten-thousand-dollar job."
</p>

<p>
"He's an innocent party."
</p>

<p>
"Sure.  Well, you got to see him quick and find out
what's been hatched.  It must be something slick, to get
past this Windsor party.  He figures to work up a fine
case against you, resign his present job in a blaze of glory,
and then start life in New York as a famous man.  The
straighter they are, the harder they fall&mdash;when they're
approached the right way.  Bet you ten bucks that when
you get to the bottom of this, you'll find there ain't a
single peg to hang Macgowan on, not a one!"
</p>

<p>
Armstrong feared that his friend was right.
</p>

<p>
Upon learning that Windsor would not be back until
the following morning, Dorns hastily consulted a
timetable, then proposed that he catch the next train to
Chicago, arrange his business there, and return to
Indianapolis the next morning.  Armstrong nodded assent.
</p>

<p>
"You get a line on Windsor," said Dorns.  "I'll be
here by nine or ten o'clock in the morning, maybe earlier.
If you can't get to him, I will.  He ain't going to refuse
to see me&mdash;not much!"
</p>

<p>
So, bidding Dorns farewell, Armstrong went about his
business frankly and bluntly, going direct to the office of
the state commissioner of securities.
</p>

<p>
He found himself welcomed by the commissioner, if not
with suspicion certainly with a lack of cordiality mingled
with astonishment.  Obviously, his name was unfavorably
known; but he lost no time in stating his case.  The
commissioner listened, eyed him appraisingly, and shook his
head.
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid it would do you no good to see him&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You misunderstand," cut in Armstrong curtly.  "I
want a hearing from Mr. Windsor before he acts further&mdash;that's
all.  I am ignorant of what charges are laid at my
door; I know only that nothing can be brought against me
or the Armstrong Company unless backed by fraud.  I
am acquainted with Mr. Windsor's character, and I
believe that he has been made use of by other parties.  If
that's the case, I want a chance to show him the facts
before this thing, whatever it is, attains publicity.  I've
nothing to conceal."
</p>

<p>
"Personally," returned the commissioner slowly, "I
have no knowledge of the exact case upon which Mr. Windsor
is working.  Certain facts came to his attention;
he requested that he be appointed special investigator to
look into your handling of the Deming Food Products
stock.  More than this I don't know.  But, Mr. Armstrong,
I do know something of recent publicity which has
come your way.  The fight which has centered around
Consolidated Securities has been widely advertised.  You
have, for example, been indicted in Illinois&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Armstrong uttered an angry laugh.
</p>

<p>
"If you'll keep your eye on that Illinois indictment,
you'll see it dismissed next week.  However, I am not
here to defend myself, nor do I wish to see Mr. Windsor
for that purpose.  Will you try to prevail upon him to see
me to-morrow, out of common justice to me?"
</p>

<p>
The commissioner nodded.
</p>

<p>
"I will.  I had a wire half an hour ago saying that he
would get in on a night train and that means we'll see
him early in the morning.  Where can I reach you?"
</p>

<p>
"At the Claypool."
</p>

<p>
"I shall telephone you at eight-thirty&mdash;but don't be too
sanguine.  I fear that he'll refuse absolutely to see you."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you."
</p>

<p>
Armstrong left, confident that he had done all that was
humanly possible.  If the stubborn Windsor still refused
an interview, things could take their course and be damned
to them.  Whatever evolved from this tangled skein,
Armstrong felt that no great harm could be done him.  And
he could not forget that, only a few hours and miles away,
was Dorothy.
</p>

<p>
"If I fail to-morrow, I'll jump the next train to
Evansville and see her," he said to himself, as he walked the
streets that afternoon.  "Perhaps time has softened her&mdash;at
least, she may give me a calm hearing.  Confound it all,
what have I done that I should have to go about the country
begging for hearings!  It's outrageous, it's damnable!"
</p>

<p>
Back at the hotel, his mood passed again into one of
despair, for loneliness took hold upon him.  It seemed that
he was engaged in an interminable struggle in which he
achieved only new defeat at every turn.  The amazing
insolence of Macgowan was insuperable; the man was a
very Antæus, rising from every onset with fresh strength
and new cunning.  At length, dreading the return of his
old despondent apathy, Armstrong forced himself to a
moving picture theater, which afforded him an hour of
mental relief and sent him to bed with the issue of things
confided to the knees of the morrow's gods.
</p>

<p>
At eight-thirty on Tuesday morning, Armstrong was
nervously pacing his room when the door was flung open
and Robert Dorns entered, unannounced.  At the same
instant, the telephone rang; with a gesture to Dorns,
Armstrong turned quickly to the instrument.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, this is Mr. Armstrong&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"The commissioner speaking, sir.  I've just seen
Mr. Windsor.  I regret to say that he refuses absolutely to
see you."
</p>

<p>
Armstrong turned and shot a glance at Dorns, watching
and listening.
</p>

<p>
"He refuses, eh?  Does he give any reason?"
</p>

<p>
"None.  I'm sorry."
</p>

<p>
Armstrong hung up the receiver, and with a gesture of
despair turned about.  Dorns eyed him, produced a cigar,
bit on it.
</p>

<p>
"Back, is he?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  No chance."
</p>

<p>
"Huh!  Had breakfast?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"So've I.  Let's go!  I want to get this thing cleaned
up and catch a noon train East.  Got to be in New York
to-morrow night sure.  Come on!  This bird sees us
inside of ten minutes."
</p>

<p>
Armstrong shrugged, caught up his hat, and followed
Dorns.  They found a taxicab at the hotel entrance.
Dorns growled at the driver.
</p>

<p>
"Statehouse.  Make it quick."
</p>

<p>
Neither man spoke for a moment, until suddenly Dorns
reached out, violently struck Armstrong's knee, and looked
the startled Armstrong in the eye.
</p>

<p>
"Wake up!" he said.  "You're at the breakin' point;
to-day is either the start or the finish for you, me lad.  I
can see it in your eye.  There's just so much any man
can stand, and you're at the end of your rope.  Buck up,
now!  Don't play Macgowan's game for him; he's been
tryin' all the while to wear you down, blast his soul!  I
know him.  He figures that if he can devil you just so
long, you'll go smash at last.  And he's right&mdash;you will.
But, me lad, hang on a bit longer.  Don't play his game
for him."
</p>

<p>
Armstrong nodded soberly.  This thought about Macgowan
was new to him; he admitted its truth without
demur.
</p>

<p>
"You're right.  I suppose I'm pretty close to the edge.
Well, thanks for the advice!  I'll hang on."
</p>

<p>
Before the statehouse, Dorns left the taxicab.
</p>

<p>
"Don't come with me, now.  Come right after me.
Where's his office?"
</p>

<p>
"With that of the attorney general."
</p>

<p>
"All right.  Loaf along after me."
</p>

<p>
Dorns swung up the steps, entered the building, with
Armstrong in his wake.  He went direct to Windsor's
office and sent his card in to Windsor.  A moment later,
Windsor himself appeared with outstretched hand and
welcoming smile.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Dorns?  I'm very glad to meet you.  This is an
unexpected honor&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Dorns grunted.  "Want to see you in private a minute."
</p>

<p>
"Gladly.  Come along!"
</p>

<p>
When they stood inside Windsor's private office, Dorns
regarded his man steadily, refused to sit down, and then
spoke with a blunt directness.
</p>

<p>
"I'm informed that you've been offered a job in New
York, with the law firm of Milligan, Milligan, Hoyt &amp;
Brainard.  Is that a fact or not?"
</p>

<p>
Windsor's eyes widened slightly.
</p>

<p>
"Eh?  Sure, it's a fact.  I wasn't aware that it had
become widely known, however.  I have accepted the offer,
which does not go into effect for some months."
</p>

<p>
"That's bad news&mdash;for you."
</p>

<p>
Windsor sensed antagonism in that hard eye, and stiffened.
A flush crept into his face.
</p>

<p>
"What d'you mean by saying that?" he demanded sharply.
</p>

<p>
Dorns jerked his head toward the door.
</p>

<p>
"Armstrong's out there and wants to see you.  If you
don't let him in, you'll go up for conspiracy and for
acceptin' a bribe&mdash;and I'll send you up, me lad!
Macgowan is back o' that fine job in New York; he's a silent
partner in this Milligan law firm.  Lord help ye, Windsor,
if this ever busts loose in the papers!  Now, I know you're
square.  I know ye weren't aware to Macgowan's part
in this.  Going to see Armstrong or not?  You're in a
deep hole, me lad; crawl out of it quick!"
</p>

<p>
Windsor stared at his informant; into his face crept a
species of horrified comprehension.  Those blunt words hit
him like so many hammers, jarring the truth into him with
smashing impact.  Nor did he so much as protest the
veracity of this information.
</p>

<p>
"Dorns&mdash;is this a fact&mdash;about Macgowan?"
</p>

<p>
"A cold fact," said Dorns.  "We know you're square;
that's why we're holdin' nothing back.  Give Armstrong
a hearing&mdash;that's all I ask.  If you're still satisfied he's a
crook, then go ahead; we'll never bleat a word about this
bribery thing.  But, if ye don't so much as give us a
show for our white alley, I'll raise hell's roof with it!
Yes or no, me lad?"
</p>

<p>
Windsor drew a deep breath, realizing that Dorns meant
every word, and assented.
</p>

<p>
"All right.  Bring him in.  Are you acting with him,
for him?"
</p>

<p>
"Nope.  I'm listening with him, that's all.  I know he's
on the level."
</p>

<p>
Dorns turned to the door.  The gaze of Windsor followed
him in puzzled and startled surmise, provoked by
those final curt words.
</p>

<p>
When Armstrong came in, Windsor was seated at his
desk, and looked up with a brief nod of greeting; he was
once more himself, and motioned silently to chairs.  Both
men sat down.
</p>

<p>
"What is it you want?" asked Windsor, steadily regarding
Armstrong.
</p>

<p>
"A chance to show that whatever charges you hold
against me are fraudulent."
</p>

<p>
Windsor swung his chair around, took a cigar from his
pocket, and lighted it.  For a moment he looked through
the window with unseeing eyes, collecting his thoughts;
then he swung about again, and faced Armstrong.
</p>

<p>
"You have a job ahead," he said ominously.  "I'm
going after you because you obtained a license to market
that stock issue of the Deming Company in this state&mdash;and
obtained it by fraud and perjury and conspiracy.
Is that enough?"
</p>

<p>
Armstrong looked incredulous.  "Enough?  You don't
mean to say that that's the basis of this affair?"
</p>

<p>
Windsor merely nodded, studying his antagonist through
the cigar smoke.  Armstrong caught his breath as the
tension snapped within him, and broke into a laugh.
</p>

<p>
"Good Lord, Windsor!  That's the simplest thing on
earth to answer.  When the license was obtained, I had no
connection with that company; it was obtained by the
previous directorate, before we took over Deming's plant!"
</p>

<p>
Windsor smiled thinly.
</p>

<p>
"Sure," he said.  "Armstrong, when I called you a
crook in New York&mdash;if you got my message&mdash;I meant the
words.  I still mean them.  I expected exactly that
answer from you.  It merely confirms my opinion.  You're
clever, but in this case I have the goods on you."
</p>

<p>
Armstrong was irritated.  "By Macgowan's aid?"
</p>

<p>
"Not a bit of it."  Windsor in turn showed a temptation
to anger, but held himself in check.  "He had nothing
to do with it.  The proofs of your crookedness were
obtained by me alone.  Macgowan's own cousin, Ried
Williams, is involved in the conspiracy."
</p>

<p>
Armstrong stifled his resentment.  He was startled,
alert, battle-cleared.
</p>

<p>
"Very well," he said crisply.  "Since you already know
that I had no connection with that stock issue, except to
market it later on, what the devil is there against me?"
</p>

<p>
Windsor smiled genially.
</p>

<p>
"I only said that I expected such an answer from you,
Armstrong.  Here are the facts, straight from the shoulder.
Ostensibly, you had nothing to do with that stock issue.
In reality, you had everything to do with it.  At your
suggestion, false statements were sworn to by the Deming
directors; the entire scheme of operations as laid out by
you was followed by them.  The fraud originated with
you.  Your man, Jimmy Wren, came to Evansville and
completed secret arrangements with Williams, at that time
Food Products' treasurer.  I have absolute proof of all
this.
</p>

<p>
"I have forced confessions from Slosson and from
Williams&mdash;affidavits which give away the whole game so
far as you're concerned, and which completely bare your
little conspiracy.  My attention was directed to the
matter in the first place by certain small investors who
demanded an investigation; this led me to uncover the facts;
these in turn led me to Williams and Slosson&mdash;and there
you are."
</p>

<p>
Windsor replaced his cigar between his teeth and
benignly regarded Armstrong.
</p>

<p>
The latter sat in silence, his brain working at high speed.
In a flash he perceived the whole scheme, and realized the
danger.  Macgowan had cooked up this affair with Williams
and Slosson, of course, had laid a very crafty train which
would lead Windsor to them.  He had carefully covered
his own tracks, and had placed Armstrong in a serious
predicament.
</p>

<p>
The cool audacity of the thing was staggering.  No
wonder Windsor was convinced by the evidence furnished
him!  Affidavits from two of the former Deming directors,
actually implicating themselves, probably supported by
cunning additional evidence twisted out of the truth to
suit the occasion&mdash;why, it was damning!
</p>

<p>
Armstrong realized instantly that unless either Williams
or Slosson could be shaken in their statements, he was
doomed.  If they stuck by their guns, nothing could save
him.  He turned suddenly on Robert Dorns, the flicker
of a smile on his lips.
</p>

<p>
"I'd like to have Mansfield here!" he observed whimsically.
"I told him about those fraudulent statements
when Wren first discovered them, and he was certain that
the matter could never be raised against me."
</p>

<p>
"Why didn't you report them, if you knew they were
fraudulent?" shot out Windsor, pouncing on this apparent
admission of guilt.  "Why cover them up?"
</p>

<p>
"It was no business of mine."  Armstrong faced him,
realized that the crucial fight was on.  "I had nothing to
do with the statements filed by Deming's directors.  So
far as I know, they were made out by the treasurer,
Williams, and he was the only one who knew them to be
false, unless the other directors were in on the deal with
him."'
</p>

<p>
Windsor leaned back.  "Going to stick to that story?"
</p>

<p>
"You bet!  It's the truth," snapped Armstrong.
"That devil Macgowan is back of this whole thing, just
as he's behind that offer to you."
</p>

<p>
Windsor's eyes narrowed uneasily, but he shook his
head.
</p>

<p>
"I can't agree with you.  I'll look into that New York
job; and I'll say that it was white of you to give me
warning about it.  But there's no tracing these charges
back to Macgowan."
</p>

<p>
"He's behind it, none the less.  He knew about those
fraudulent statements."
</p>

<p>
Windsor quietly dissented.  "Armstrong, I've gone
through things carefully, looking for just such a connection;
I was warned of the possibility in New York.  I was
in Evansville yesterday and met Dorothy on the street;
she suggested the same idea to me&mdash;that Macgowan had
framed you.  I'm sorry for her, cursed sorry!  But the
facts are open.  You're the boss in this thing, and there's
enough contributory evidence to put you behind the bars."
</p>

<p>
"I don't doubt it; Macgowan seems to have done this
job up brown!"  Armstrong leaned forward earnestly.
From the look on Dorns' face, he knew that he was at a
critical point.  "Now, Windsor, I insisted on seeing you
because I knew you were honestly convinced.  You believe
I'm a crook, don't you?"
</p>

<p>
"Absolutely," said Windsor calmly.
</p>

<p>
"On the evidence of two men whom I threw out of Food
Products because they had wrecked that company.  Good.
Suppose we call on Williams and Slosson.  Let me talk
to 'em in your presence.  If they stick to their lies, I'm
through.  Let the matter come up in court and be fought
out.  If not&mdash;it's up to you."
</p>

<p>
Windsor removed his cigar and surveyed Armstrong
with an indolent air which masked his keen eagerness.
</p>

<p>
"Either you're the nerviest devil I've ever met or&mdash;well,
I'll take you up!  Wait till I get copies of those
affidavits.  Back in a minute."
</p>

<p>
He sprang to his feet and went into the adjoining office.
</p>

<p>
Armstrong waited.  Inwardly, his thoughts had been
wrenched aside by Windsor's mention of Evansville, of
Dorothy; a fierce, fighting exultation swept through him.
So she had appealed to Windsor&mdash;she had cared enough to
do this thing!
</p>

<p>
"By gad, that means a lot!" he muttered.  "A lot!
She's had time to think it over, and there's still hope&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The voice of Windsor came from the next room, addressing
his stenographer.
</p>

<p>
"If anything important comes up, call me at the office
of Williams &amp; Slosson, across from the Board of
Trade&mdash;you know where it is."
</p>

<p>
Windsor appeared.  "All right," he said.  "Let's go!"
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VII
</h3>

<p>
The brokerage firm of Williams &amp; Slosson had not
yet arrived at the point of throwing away money
on externals.  The offices consisted of a reception
room and outer office, and two private offices, in one
of the old buildings across from the Board of Trade.
</p>

<p>
Under their windows was Monument Place.  All the
life of the city flowed around and through and under the
monument; from his desk, Ried Williams had beneath his
eyes the pulsing heart of Indianapolis.  Upon this particular
Tuesday morning, however, he was taking no interest
whatever in the view.  He had arrived early at the office
and was in irritable humor.
</p>

<p>
"No word yet from Mr. Slosson?" he snapped at the typist.
</p>

<p>
"No, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Confound it!  Nine o'clock now&mdash;here, call up his
hotel and get him on the line if he's there.  If not, see if
they've heard from him."
</p>

<p>
Five minutes later, Williams uttered a grunt of satisfaction
as he seized his desk telephone and heard the sleepy
accents of his partner.
</p>

<p>
"Where've you been, Pete?  Why didn't you show
up here yesterday&mdash;what?"  He paused, listening, and
changed countenance.  "What's that?  Robbed and
thrown off the train?  What have you done about it?"
</p>

<p>
He listened anew, his sallow features tightening with
anxiety.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I suppose you did right to say nothing," he
admitted.  "You don't know who it was, eh?  Were you
drunk?  Oh, never mind all that&mdash;I know you.  Well, get
dressed and get down here right away.  You've had a fine
long spree in New York, and now you're going to watch
your step&mdash;what?  Yes, the checks came in this morning's
mail; Macgowan must have sent them out first thing
yesterday morning.  Get down here, now, and get down at once.
All right."
</p>

<p>
Williams hung up the receiver.  As he did so, his door
opened and the typist appeared.
</p>

<p>
"There are three men here to see you," she said.
"Mr. Windsor&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The eyes of Williams darted to his desk.  He hastily
dropped certain papers into the top drawer, closed it, and
nodded.
</p>

<p>
"Very well, bring them in,"' he said.
</p>

<p>
"Good morning," said Windsor, as he entered the
office.  "Mr. Williams, here are Mr. Armstrong and his
friend Mr. Dorns.  I've consented to let Armstrong ask
a few questions about those affidavits, if you don't mind.
Where's Slosson?"
</p>

<p>
At hearing this, at sight of Armstrong and Robert Dorns,
Williams stiffened.  His darkly vulpine features turned a
shade lighter; his crafty eyes settled on the gaze of
Armstrong with a species of crafty boldness.  Beholding
himself unexpectedly cornered, he rose to the occasion with an
outward display of assurance which, however desperate it
was, betrayed no weakness or hesitation.
</p>

<p>
"I am entirely at your service, gentlemen," he said
coldly.  "Mr. Slosson has been in New York&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Why, I thought he'd be back before this!" exclaimed
Windsor.
</p>

<p>
"He should have been.  I had a telephone message from
him, a moment ago that he would be at the office in a few
moments.  It appears that en route here he was assaulted
and robbed and thrown off his train.  I had not learned of
it before now, and know no details.  Sit down, please.
We might as well be comfortable."
</p>

<p>
Armstrong perceived danger in this admirable sang-froid,
and from that moment despaired of his purpose.
This man was not to be browbeaten or tricked; only some
accident, some slight word or action, could overcome him.
Accordingly Armstrong, who now had himself perfectly
in hand, plunged straight into the midst of things with as
quiet and businesslike an air as he could summon up.  He
glanced at the copy of the affidavit in his hand, then spoke
calmly.
</p>

<p>
"You know what I want to ask you, of course.  This
affidavit that you gave Mr. Windsor is the cause of our
visit."
</p>

<p>
"So I presume."  Williams was imperturbable.  "As
you may imagine, it was not given of my own choice, but
from necessity."
</p>

<p>
"Every statement in this affidavit," went on Armstrong
coolly, "is false&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"One moment, if you please," intervened Williams, and
looked up at Windsor.  "May I inquire whether this
conversation is to be made a matter of record?  In such
event, I should like to have my lawyer present."
</p>

<p>
Windsor nodded.  "If you like, of course.  But this is
entirely informal and between ourselves.  You are
compelled to answer nothing."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you.  In that case, Mr. Armstrong, proceed.
I have nothing to conceal."
</p>

<p>
Armstrong faced defeat, and knew it.
</p>

<p>
"The statements in this affidavit will have to be backed
up on the stand," he continued.  "You realize that?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly."
</p>

<p>
"You say that I corresponded with you in regard to the
Deming Company's affairs, in June of last year, urging
you to put upon the market a stock issue which I might
handle.  What proof have you of such a statement?  Are
you able to produce the correspondence?"
</p>

<p>
"As you are aware," and Williams smiled slightly,
"you instructed me to destroy the two letters which I had
from you.  I so did.  Mr. Slosson read them, however, and
will be able to reproduce their gist."
</p>

<p>
Armstrong compressed his lips.  At every step, the trap
was closing more firmly.
</p>

<p>
"Then," he went on slowly, "you say that complete
instructions regarding this stock issue were given you
verbally, by my representative Wren, in Evansville on the
tenth of July last&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Slosson was a witness to the conversation," struck
in Williams smoothly.
</p>

<p>
"&mdash;and that he advised you," pursued Armstrong, "to
falsify the company's financial statement in such a
manner that blue sky licenses might be obtained."
</p>

<p>
"Do you deny that Wren did so?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course," said Armstrong impatiently.  "He was in
Evansville then, and I believe that he interviewed you,
gaining certain information about the standing of the
company.  I understood that it was in bad shape, due to
incompetent directors, and was making plans to the end of
helping Mr. Deming to retrieve the lost ground&mdash;but Wren
certainly never made such proposals as you here assert."
</p>

<p>
Windsor was intent, Dorns was frowning; Ried Williams
shrugged and spoke with an assumed helplessness that was
very well done.
</p>

<p>
"Of course, Armstrong, passing the lie does no good
here and now."
</p>

<p>
Armstrong looked at him.
</p>

<p>
"Williams, how long has Slosson been in New York?"
</p>

<p>
This question brought a narrowing of the other man's
lids.
</p>

<p>
"A week, or a little over."
</p>

<p>
"Did you or Macgowan send him to my house?"
</p>

<p>
To all three of his listeners, this question brought
startled surprise, for Dorns knew nothing of Armstrong's
recent domestic trouble.  For an instant Williams was so
badly shaken that Armstrong thought the victory won.
</p>

<p>
"Your house?" repeated Williams, bewildered and
wildly alarmed.  "What the devil was he doing there?"
</p>

<p>
"Talking," said Armstrong.  Perceiving the advantage
of reticence, and being himself ignorant of Slosson's exact
errand at Aircastle Point, he gave the frowning Windsor
a slight smile.  Obviously, that gentleman thought that
Slosson had given Armstrong warning of this whole affair,
and was disturbed thereby.  Armstrong shifted his ground
quickly.
</p>

<p>
"As you very well know, at the time you charge that I
was conspiring with you, my affairs were all in the hands
of Lawrence Macgowan.  Just where does he enter into
this matter?"
</p>

<p>
Williams hesitated slightly before this shrewd demand.
</p>

<p>
"So far as I know," he responded, "he was not connected
with it at all."
</p>

<p>
"Really?"  Armstrong laughed.  "When, at the time, he
was my personal adviser and chief aid?  You never
suspected that he was involved or had knowledge of this?"
</p>

<p>
"No," said Williams stubbornly.
</p>

<p>
"Not even when, after my marriage, he handled on my
behalf all the negotiations which ended in Consolidated
Securities taking over Food Products?"
</p>

<p>
Williams rallied.  "The matter was never discussed
between us," he responded.  "If Macgowan was aware of
the matter, he never mentioned it."
</p>

<p>
"Yet you are relatives," persisted Armstrong.  "And
you have been very intimate with him, particularly of
late.  You were in Wilmington at the annual meeting of
Consolidated, and voted ten thousand shares of stock, paid
for with your note for five thousand dollars.  Before you
went to Wilmington, you must have been aware of Mr. Windsor's
active interest in this present affair&mdash;isn't that
so, Windsor?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Windsor quietly.  Armstrong looked at Williams.
</p>

<p>
"Then you did not discuss the matter with Macgowan
while you were in Wilmington?"
</p>

<p>
"No."  Williams clenched his thin lips for an instant.
"No.  He was too much occupied with his campaign to
give time to outside matters."
</p>

<p>
"That is very extraordinary."  Armstrong laughed
again.  "You'll have to fix up a better story on that
before you go on the witness stand, I warn you!  Then you
don't know about Slosson coming to my house, or what
took place as a result of his call?"
</p>

<p>
Fear leaped into the eyes of Williams again, yet he
answered quickly and with obvious sincerity that impressed
even Armstrong.
</p>

<p>
"No.  We went to New York together, and separated.
I haven't seen him since, and he certainly did not intend
seeing you."
</p>

<p>
Windsor intervened quietly.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Armstrong, may I ask just what did take place
as a result of his call on you?"
</p>

<p>
"I can't answer that question now."  Armstrong paled
slightly; a spark leaped into his eyes.  "Wait until
Slosson gets here, and we'll have the matter out then."
</p>

<p>
So far as Williams was concerned, he knew himself
beaten.  Dorns, who was sitting close to Williams' desk,
must have known it also; but the sharp eye of Dorns had
been prying about that desk.  Now Dorns leaned forward,
and reached out one long arm.
</p>

<p>
"D'ye mind if I look at this?" he said, and extricated
a half-concealed check from among the papers there.
Williams did not answer, but sat immobile, silent, his eyes
narrowed upon Dorns.  The latter shrugged, and handed
the check to Windsor.
</p>

<p>
"This ain't my funeral," he said.  "But you might like
to ask questions yourself."
</p>

<p>
Windsor inspected the check, and glanced up at Ried
Williams.
</p>

<p>
"A check for five thousand from Consolidated?"
</p>

<p>
Armstrong thrilled to those words, but Williams only
nodded slightly.
</p>

<p>
"Certainly.  What is wrong about that?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing," said Windsor slowly.  "But I don't like
your close connection with Macgowan.  May I ask what
this check is to cover?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course."  Williams, with perfect aplomb, leaned
over and drew a second check from the top drawer of his
desk.  "Here is another check of similar amount drawn
to Mr. Slosson.  Both are dated April tenth, you will
observe.  They constitute payment to us for services
rendered in placing a stock issue for them."
</p>

<p>
"What stock issue?" demanded Armstrong crisply.
</p>

<p>
"That of the National Reduction Company."  Williams
met his gaze squarely.
</p>

<p>
"Ten thousand dollars commission, eh?  So you're in
on the looting too.  Whew!  You got a fine slice, Williams.
Do you happen to have any record of the transaction?"
</p>

<p>
"I have records showing that we placed this entire
stock issue with brokerage houses in Chicago," returned
Williams.  "But I've no intention of exposing the
business of a client to the active enemy of that client.  If
Mr. Windsor wants to see the records, that's another thing
entirely."
</p>

<p>
"I think I'd like to see them," spoke up Windsor quietly.
</p>

<p>
Ried Williams touched a button on his desk, and his
typist entered.  He instructed her to bring the records in
regard to the National Reduction stock issue, and she
retired.
</p>

<p>
Armstrong, who had hoped for a moment that they had
at last stumbled upon something, immediately perceived
that Williams had fortified himself against every
contingency.  Those two checks had undoubtedly come for
services rendered at Wilmington; unless, indeed, they had
come as payment for the perjury and fraud which Williams
and Slosson were perpetrating in this very affair with
Windsor!  No matter if Windsor's suspicions were now
aroused, the crafty Ried Williams would scrape through.
</p>

<p>
The typist appeared, but without the records.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Windsor is wanted at the telephone," she
announced.  "By his office."
</p>

<p>
"Give me the call here, please."  Windsor reached for
the desk telephone.  "Yes?"  He listened for a moment,
then an expression of amazement crossed his face.
"Who?  Wait a minute&mdash;say that over again!  What's
the amount?  Give me the date, please."
</p>

<p>
The typist entered, handed the records required to
Williams, and closed the door again.
</p>

<p>
"Very well," said Windsor.  "You're sure of that date,
are you?  Good.  Why, you'd better come over here right
away.  Yes, bring them along."
</p>

<p>
He hung up the receiver.  It appeared that his call had
no relation to the business in hand, for he turned to
Williams at once.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  You have the records?"
</p>

<p>
He took the typed sheets and glanced through them
rapidly.  Then, with a nod, he returned them to Williams.
</p>

<p>
"What other sums have you received lately from
Macgowan's company?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"None," said Williams composedly.  "As you see, this
transaction is closed."
</p>

<p>
"Then you and Slosson have no further business under
way with Consolidated?"
</p>

<p>
"None."
</p>

<p>
"And these two checks dated the tenth are the final
step in the transaction?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
Windsor nodded.  "I see.  This appears to be perfectly
straight, Armstrong.  Are there any further questions
you'd like to ask?"
</p>

<p>
Armstrong knew that he was checked.  He was in a
trap from which there was no way out; all the exits had
been blocked by so cleverly woven a fabric of perjury that
he could do nothing except struggle in futile passion.
</p>

<p>
At this instant the door opened and Pete Slosson
appeared on the threshold.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII
</h3>

<p>
Slosson stared at the men facing him.  Dorns he
did not know; the sight of Windsor and Armstrong
here together brought an angry glint into his eyes.
One of those eyes was very discolored, his face was bruised
and cut, and his right hand was half concealed in bandages.
</p>

<p>
"Come in, Mr. Slosson," said Windsor genially, yet
with a certain repressed eagerness in his voice which
caused Armstrong to wonder.  "You know Mr. Armstrong,
I think; this is Mr. Robert Dorns.  We came over
here in order that you and Mr. Williams might answer a
few questions in regard to these affidavits, if you don't
mind.  Nothing compulsory at all.  Mr. Armstrong merely
wishes to satisfy himself on certain points.  You look as
though you'd had a pretty bad accident."
</p>

<p>
"I did."  Slosson entered, dropped his hat on a chair,
and himself into another.  "I was robbed and dropped
off my train&mdash;had a devil of a time.  Well, what can I do
for you?"
</p>

<p>
He flung a glance at Dorns which was half defiant,
half alarmed.  The name must have startled him.  Dorns,
being the man he was, took instant advantage of what he
read in Slosson's glance, and leaned forward.
</p>

<p>
"I'd like to know," he said, hard of eye and voice,
"just what took place at Armstrong's house when you
called there&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Not so fast, Mr. Dorns," cut in Windsor coolly.
"Mr. Armstrong is doing the questioning here, if you please,
and so am I.  Do you care to answer that question
Mr. Slosson?  This is a conversation among ourselves,
understand, and not a matter of record."
</p>

<p>
"It's none of his business, then," shot out Slosson
defiantly.
</p>

<p>
Windsor smiled in his cordial manner, and glanced at
Armstrong.
</p>

<p>
"Do you care to ask the question now, or defer it?" he
inquired.
</p>

<p>
Armstrong suddenly perceived something tense in the
manner of Windsor, and this query startled him into swift
thought.
</p>

<p>
"I'd like to see Slosson in your presence, or in private,"
he rejoined calmly.  Under his look, Slosson's bold gaze
wavered.  "I'll defer my questions, if you wish."
</p>

<p>
"Very well, then."  Windsor produced a cigar and
mouthed it, unlighted.  "Mr. Slosson, there's something
I'd like to ask you myself.  A check for five thousand
dollars was made out to you by Consolidated Securities on
the eighth day of April, Saturday last&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"It was made out on&mdash;"  The intervention of Williams
was swiftly checked.
</p>

<p>
"Be quiet, please!" cut in Windsor curtly.  "I'm asking
this question."
</p>

<p>
Williams sat back in his chair, his furtive eyes filled with
uneasiness.  Windsor looked again at Slosson, who was
frowning suspiciously.  Armstrong and Dorns, equally
puzzled to understand what Tom Windsor was driving at,
awaited some clue.
</p>

<p>
"This check was made out to you on April eighth.  I'd
like you to tell me why it was given you&mdash;for what
service."
</p>

<p>
Slosson was obviously doing some quick thinking.
Windsor took from the desk the two checks and idly
fingered them, as though the discrepancy in his dates were
of no moment.  Slosson darted a look at his partner, then
made response with a shrug.
</p>

<p>
"Why, we put over a deal in the stock of a new company
for Consolidated, and those checks were given in
payment for our services."
</p>

<p>
"I see," said Windsor, and nodded.  He regarded
Slosson, a reflective look in his clear gaze.  "Mr. Williams
has already given us the details of the affair.  You see,
our friend Armstrong, here, suspected that there might be
some connection between my case against him and
Lawrence Macgowan.  We are endeavoring to disabuse his
mind of that impression, and it is important that both you
and Williams be absolutely frank and open with me."
</p>

<p>
Slosson threw Armstrong an angry, defiant glance.
</p>

<p>
"You'll not get away with any of your fancy bluffs
around here&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Just a moment, please!" intervened Windsor pleasantly.
Both Armstrong and Dorns were now watching
him keenly.  Ried Williams was watching both him and
Slosson, in uneasy and anxious suspense.  "Mr. Slosson,
I understand that you've had no further relations with
Macgowan, beyond this transaction?"
</p>

<p>
"That's right," affirmed Slosson.
</p>

<p>
"These two checks are all that you have received or will
receive?"
</p>

<p>
"Sure.  We want nothing else to do with Macgowan or
his company, I can tell you!" rejoined Slosson easily.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" said Windsor.  "But it is a most extraordinary
fact that these two checks are dated yesterday&mdash;the tenth!
Whereas, the other check, also in the sum of five
thousand dollars, issued to you on the eighth&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He paused meditatively.
</p>

<p>
In the moment of silence that ensued, Slosson realized
that he had made a frightful blunder.  As the others
realized that Windsor must have some information of
which they knew nothing, they tensed; the air of the
room became charged, vibrant.  Slosson burst out in a
swift and angry denial, as vehement as it was inspired.
</p>

<p>
"There was another check, yes!  I called up Macgowan
about this ten thousand, on Saturday morning&mdash;told him
we wanted the money.  He said he'd mail out the check
Monday.  I told him that wouldn't do.  He said he'd
send me one for five thousand then, to my hotel, and would
mail Williams another for five thousand on Monday, and
I assented.  That check was in my pocket when I was
robbed.  How the devil you knew about it, I don't know
or care!  I called up Macgowan long distance on Sunday
morning, from the town where I was picked up, and he
agreed to stop payment on that check and send me
another with Ried's on Monday.  That's how there were two
checks issued."
</p>

<p>
In the eyes of Ried Williams gleamed admiration, but
only for an instant.  Windsor nodded assent.
</p>

<p>
"I see," he said suggestively.  "Then of course your
explanation can be easily proven."
</p>

<p>
"Sure it can!" blustered Slosson.  "Call up Macgowan
long distance and see."
</p>

<p>
A knock sounded at the door.  The typist entered, and
looked at Windsor.
</p>

<p>
"There are some people here to see you, sir&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Windsor leaped to his feet.  "I'll see them outside.
Wait here, gentlemen!"
</p>

<p>
He went out, closed the door, but almost instantly was
back in the room.  In his hand was a slip of paper.  He
went to the desk, and then turned to Slosson.  All the
genial tolerance was suddenly gone from his air; here was
the assistant attorney general, curt, crisp, suspicious.  His
words came like a whipcrack:
</p>

<p>
"Come here and endorse this check, Slosson.  We'll
send it out to a bank and have them call up New York
about the number of this check."
</p>

<p>
Mechanically Slosson stepped forward.  It was a moment
before he could actually realize that this was the
check, the identical bit of paper, of which he had been
robbed.  Then a tide of color leaped into his cheeks, and
with an abrupt outburst of fury he caught up the check
and tore it asunder.
</p>

<p>
"So you hired a thug to waylay me, did you?" he cried
out at Armstrong.  "Thought you'd lay a trap for me,
did you?"'
</p>

<p>
The words died upon his lips as he perceived the absolute
futility of speech.  Williams had sunk back in his chair,
ashen to the lips; Windsor was cold and accusative, though
silent.  Armstrong and Dorns were on their feet, eager,
watching, tense.  Then, in the moment of silence, Windsor
went to the office door and opened it.
</p>

<p>
"Come in, please," he said.  Jimmy Wren and Dorothy
Armstrong entered.
</p>

<p>
Armstrong stiffened as he met the jubilant grin of Wren
and looked past him to see Dorothy.  Into her cheeks
mounted a faint color upon meeting the gaze of her
husband, but she was given no chance to speak, for the
moment.  Windsor addressed Jimmy Wren curtly.
</p>

<p>
"Wren, where did you get this check?"
</p>

<p>
Jimmy Wren regarded the bruised features of Slosson,
and chuckled heartily.
</p>

<p>
"Out of that bird's pocket.  We had a scrap on the
train, and went over the rail&mdash;he was pretty drunk, and
got a grip on my throat that's there yet!"  He grinned
again as a low exclamation broke from Slosson.  "Didn't
know me, did you?  Well, I knew you, Slosson!  Why, as
to the check, Mr. Windsor, I took all the papers I found on
him.  Yep, deliberately and with malice aforethought, you
might say.  Got that check, and a few other things, and
Mrs. Armstrong helped me figure matters out and then
brought me here to see you.  Looks like I'd landed right
in the middle of a party, too!  By the way, Windsor,
here's a letter of introduction you might like to glance
over.  Macgowan sent Slosson to that Milligan law firm
and told 'em to lay the town at his feet, and said what
a good friend Slosson was&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Give me those papers!" burst forth Slosson.  "I
demand&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The huge hand of Robert Dorns dropped on his shoulder
and crushed him into a chair.
</p>

<p>
"Sit there, me lad!  Your demands don't go here."
</p>

<p>
From the broken figure of Ried Williams sounded a low
groan.  Windsor quietly glanced over the letter that
Jimmy Wren handed him, and a flame shot into his eyes.
He looked at Slosson with contempt, then turned to Ried
Williams.
</p>

<p>
"So that offer of a job in New York was a bribe, was
it?"
</p>

<p>
Williams swallowed hard.  "It&mdash;Macgowan thought
it&mdash;that it would repay you&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
His voice died out.  Windsor swung from him.  "Gentlemen,
kindly remember those words.  Mr. Armstrong, I
withdraw all my previous words to you, and apologize for
them.  I'm going to the bottom of this thing&mdash;and I don't
think the bottom's very deep now.  Williams, here is your
one and only chance: Do you wish to withdraw those
affidavits in regard to how Armstrong handled Food
Products stock, or not?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Williams in a hollow voice.  "Yes.
They&mdash;we were mistaken about his part in things&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Very well," said Tom Windsor crisply.  "Mr. Armstrong,
I congratulate you.  I'm going through with this
thing whether you prosecute or not.  Now, Williams,
turn around to that desk and write out a statement for
me."
</p>

<p>
Armstrong found Dorns pulling at his elbow.  "Let me
have a word with you outside, quick!  Mr. Windsor, I'm
glad to have met you; I want to catch a noon train for
New York.  Let me know if you want any testimony from
me in this matter, and you'll get it."
</p>

<p>
Armstrong followed him outside and closed the door.
Dorns turned and caught his hand in a hard, cordial grip
that spoke more than words.
</p>

<p>
"We've done it, me lad&mdash;hurray!  Talk quick, now.
D'you want to prosecute Macgowan or will you make
terms?  Windsor is goin' after him anyhow, I take it."
</p>

<p>
"If we can chuck him and Findlater out of Consolidated,
I'll make terms," said Armstrong promptly.  "But we've
no direct evidence on Macgowan yet&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Windsor's getting it now." Dorns grinned.  "We'll
take a leaf out o' Mac's own book, and arrest him anyhow.
I'll get hold of Judge Holcomb to-morrow and we'll nab
him for conspiracy.  You see to it at this end that no
warning is sent him.  Trust me and Holcomb to arrange
a settlement, will you?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course.  But I'll want both him and Findlater out
of the company."
</p>

<p>
"Listen!"  Dorns tapped him on the breast.  "When I
get done with that crook to-morrow night, he'll be
clean&mdash;clean!  So long, and good luck.  I got to rush.  Where'll
I wire you?"
</p>

<p>
Armstrong's face brightened in a smile.
</p>

<p>
"Wire me&mdash;well, wire me at Evansville, and hope for
the best!"
</p>

<p>
Dorns clapped him on the shoulder, and was gone.
</p>

<p>
Armstrong went back into the private office.  Slosson,
in a dazed panic, had just been checked in an outburst of
speech by Windsor.  As for Ried Williams, he was a
broken man.
</p>

<p>
"I have a little matter to settle with Slosson," said
Armstrong quietly.  "Strictly a personal matter, Mr. Windsor.
Dorothy, will you kindly go into the adjoining
office and wait for us?"
</p>

<p>
He received a smiling assent from her that made his
heart leap, and she left the room.  Windsor put out a
hand to Armstrong.
</p>

<p>
"Hold on a second!  What was that about Slosson being
at your house?"
</p>

<p>
"That's what I'm going to find out now."  Armstrong
turned to Slosson.  "Come along!"
</p>

<p>
"What for?" demanded the other with a show of defiance.
</p>

<p>
Armstrong answered very softly.
</p>

<p>
"Either you come or I'll force you.  Why, you damned
cur, do you want me to drag you in there by the collar?"
</p>

<p>
Slosson turned to the door without a word.  Armstrong
paused for an instant to grip the hand of Jimmy Wren,
and to utter a quick word.
</p>

<p>
"Jimmy, you're all right!  Watch out, now, that no
warning message is sent Macgowan.  I'll be back in a few
minutes."
</p>

<p>
Dorothy was seated before the desk in Slosson's office.
When the two men entered, she looked up at them; under
her gaze, the sullen eyes of Slosson dropped.
</p>

<p>
"Our friend is going to tell us something, Dorothy."  Armstrong
motioned to a chair.  "Sit down, Slosson."
</p>

<p>
The other man stole a half-frightened glance at him,
flinching under the crisp asperity of the words.  He was
startled and perturbed at the very manner of Armstrong,
which was all untouched by victory.  The intoxication of
that sweeping triumph in the other office had now gone
entirely from him.  No trace of emotion, of exultancy, of
domination, showed in him.  He was his usual cool self, as
though this affair were of no very great import.
</p>

<p>
Yet to Slosson this imperturbable calm was terrible;
behind it, he sensed an inexorable and frightful force
which was moving to crush him.  Despite his guilty
conscience he did not entirely comprehend what was coming
next.  His own wretched blunders, the abject breakdown
they had caused in Williams, his exposure at the hands of
Jimmy Wren&mdash;all had left him confused and helpless.
Behind his remnants of effrontery, he was conscious that
he faced prison.  All the fabric of his strutting and
posturing had been stripped away.  He beheld himself as
these other people beheld him, and the reality staggered
him.
</p>

<p>
"When I was away in Wilmington," said Armstrong,
watching him closely, "you came one morning to my home.
Suppose you relate what passed between you and
Mrs. Armstrong."
</p>

<p>
A sudden pallor crept across the face of Slosson.
According to the code by which men of his caliber lived and
moved, he saw himself facing a retribution of swift and
brutal personal violence&mdash;a bullet, perhaps.  He knew no
other code.
</p>

<p>
Then, as he hesitated, Dorothy spoke quietly.  "I can
tell you, Reese."  Armstrong turned to her.  He was
conscious of a sense of relief in her manner, a gladness that
everything at last was coming open before them.  She
went on, without heat:
</p>

<p>
"He came with a pretended warning for you, Reese.  He
had learned, he said, about this case of Tom Windsor's
and wanted to warn you.  Now I know that he lied to me.
Also, he told me that you had robbed my father, that you
had planned long ahead of time to take Food Products
away from him&mdash;oh, it was so cleverly done, Reese!  I was
completely taken in.  I had been led to suspect the Food
Products affair, from little things&mdash;it was Macgowan all
the time, making me think so!  I believe now that it was
all a terrible lie, Reese.  Well, after Slosson went away,
I called Jimmy Wren at Wilmington.  He admitted that
he had been in Evansville a month before our wedding&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Armstrong nodded, no trace of any emotion marring the
even calm of his features.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Jimmy was there.  We knew that Food Products
was going under.  Jimmy was observing the general conduct
of things at the plant, and I was trying to formulate
some method of saving the company."
</p>

<p>
"According to Slosson," and Dorothy looked squarely
at the man, "Jimmy was then making arrangements with
the directors to take the company out of father's hands!"
</p>

<p>
Armstrong laughed.  "And according to Macgowan,
Jimmy was then arranging to issue the stock, acting as a
go-between from me to the old directors.  Well, Pete?
How about it?"
</p>

<p>
Under their gaze, Slosson whitened still further, wet his
lips, could not answer.  His whole cosmos of artifice and
peacock lies had crashed down about him.  No longer was
he a fine arbiter of destiny, one whose subtle genius could
control things around&mdash;but a petty trickster, unmasked,
facing retribution.  One could see the horror of this
exposure, the bitter physical fear of Armstrong, working in
his brain.
</p>

<p>
"Speak up!" snapped Armstrong.  He moved slightly;
a movement of swift restraint.  It became suddenly
evident that this calm manner of his was deceptive; his was
the quiet of effort, of tension, of a sane mind controlling
surging impulses.  "Do you want me to make you speak,
you cur?"
</p>

<p>
Slosson broke.
</p>

<p>
"No, no!"  The wretched man threw out his hands in a
miserable gesture of despair.  "I&mdash;it was all false,
Dorothy.  It&mdash;that visit&mdash;Macgowan wanted me to do it all,
to tell you those things&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He paused.  His dead and lifeless voice rang upon the
stillness of the room with inert tones.
</p>

<p>
"He wanted you to think that&mdash;that Armstrong had
robbed your father.  He'd been working a long time to
make you believe that.  When you were in Evansville at
Christmas, Williams said something that was meant to be
overheard by you&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He lifted his glance to Dorothy.  What he read in her
eyes caused the words to falter on his lips, brought a slow,
deep tide of color into his face.  He came to his feet and
went stumblingly out of the office; nor was his departure
stayed.
</p>

<p>
When the door had closed, Armstrong rose and went to
Dorothy's side.
</p>

<p>
"Lady!" he said softly.  She raised her face to him.
</p>

<p>
"Reese&mdash;can you forgive me?"
</p>

<p>
A happy laugh shook him as his arm went about her
shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"Dear lady&mdash;forget everything but our gladness!
Everything's won, but the best of all is that I've won you
back.  Nothing else matters now; Macgowan, all the rest
of it!"
</p>

<p>
She was silent a long moment, trembling against him,
blinded with quick tears of joy.  Then, suddenly, she
moved.
</p>

<p>
"Dear&mdash;is it true?  That everything is won, and the
fight over?"
</p>

<p>
"I think so," he said gravely.  "Yes."
</p>

<p>
"I'm so glad!  And I know what's in your heart, Reese,
what your eyes are shining about!  The sixteen thousand&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, plague take the sixteen thousand!"  His laugh
rang out clear and vibrant.  "It's you, my dear, you!
Just ourselves, set right again."
</p>

<p>
A tremulous smile broke on her lips.  "Yes&mdash;and I've
been so jealous of those sixteen thousand!  Now kiss
me&mdash;and forget everything&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Their lips met.

<h3>
CHAPTER IX
</h3>

<p>
Wednesday night in New York&mdash;a warm,
sweet night of April.  The windows of
Mrs. Fowler's apartment were open to the touch of
melting spring that drifted in from Central Park, just
across the street.
</p>

<p>
Lawrence Macgowan glanced across the room, caught the
eye of Mrs. Fowler, and a slight smile touched his lips.
Undoubtedly his hostess quite comprehended the subtle
depths of that smile, for her answering glance was
whimsical and flitted lightly to Mrs. Findlater.  For Henry
C. Findlater was here, pursily important, and his wife&mdash;a
meek, colorless woman who was distinctly not at her ease.
</p>

<p>
Here, too, was Milligan, of the law firm in which
Macgowan was silently interested; and Harry Lorenz, a
cynically genial bachelor who cherished a fancied resemblance
to John Drew; and finally Mrs. Fowler's accompanist, one
Percival Hemingway.  This last was a smoothly sweet
person who spoke in lisping accents mild and was a
delicately cultured soul.  His affiliations with a musical
journal made him quite useful at times.
</p>

<p>
Over this gathering Macgowan reigned supreme, for
various and sundry reasons.  He was deferred to and
lionized, and enjoyed himself mightily&mdash;enjoyed the
half-frightened toadying of Findlater, enjoyed above all the
art of his hostess.  For Mrs. Fowler could sing, and
Macgowan, possessing a real discrimination, laid at her feet a
tribute of appreciation which was sincere.
</p>

<p>
When she rose and asked for suggestions, it was at
Macgowan that she glanced.
</p>

<p>
"Don't let Percival trot out any of his favorite problem
pieces," he responded.  "Save 'em for the concerts,
Percy&mdash;sweet angel!  Let's have something with music in it,
and none of this French and Swedish stuff.  The older the
better, I say."
</p>

<p>
Harry Lorenz spoke up, his mustache lifting in a thin
and ironic smile.
</p>

<p>
"Quite so, quite so!" he approved smoothly.  "There's
one thing, Mrs. Fowler, which I should like to hear you
sing.  I believe it would be distinctly appropriate, and is
quite in line with Mac's suggestion.  My request number
is&mdash;'He Shall Feed His Flock.'"
</p>

<p>
At this, Milligan broke into a roar of laughter, while
Findlater discreetly smothered his smile.  Macgowan,
relishing the cynicism of his friend, tendered Mrs. Fowler a
smiling nod of assent.
</p>

<p>
"By all means!  It's one of the few perfect things; the
simplest is always the best in music, despite the critics.
Percival, don't look so pained!  It won't hurt you to get
back to the farm for once and see where real music came
from.  Have you the number?  And look up some Cherubini
while you're about it."
</p>

<p>
Hemingway began to rustle through the cabinet.
Macgowan turned to the others, with his amused chuckle.
</p>

<p>
"Harry, there's more truth than poetry in your palpable
hit!  I've a grand idea for Consolidated to take hold
of, if our esteemed president in the corner yonder doesn't
sit on the notion.  How about an Academy of Musical
Art, eh?  Plenty of money in the idea&mdash;at least, in the
stock end of it.  Something new in the stock line, too."
</p>

<p>
Findlater started slightly.  "Come, Lawrence!  You're
not serious?"
</p>

<p>
"Dead serious."  Macgowan eyed his uneasy victim and
chuckled again.  "Put Mrs. Fowler at the head of it.  Get
some of these vaudeville hicks from the Village, plaster 'em
with Russian names and titles, call it the Imperial Russian
Academy.  How's that?  Can't you see the provinces falling
for that stuff, Harry?"
</p>

<p>
"Splendid!" responded Lorenz with enthusiasm.
"You've said something, Mac!  Why not widen out into a
general cultural establishment?  Teach the fine arts,
writing, painting, dancing, a course on social accuracy and
when to tuck napkins in the neck!  Anybody can teach
anything.  With a prince or a countess in charge of each
department you'll put the S.R.O. sign up in a month's
time!  Even Broadway will fall for it hard."
</p>

<p>
Findlater struggled for air.  "But, Macgowan&mdash;er&mdash;you
don't really purpose that Consolidated should back
such a project?"
</p>

<p>
"Surely you'd not veto it?" returned Macgowan.  His
genial words, however, were accompanied by a sudden
flashing glance which caused Findlater to change
countenance.  "Think of it, Henry C.!  Every one who buys a
share of stock can send the young hopeful to the Imperial
Russian Academy at reduced rates; think how the nobility
worshipers will eat it up!  What say, Milligan?"
</p>

<p>
The lawyer nodded thoughtful approval.
</p>

<p>
"It looks like a good scheme.  As a stock proposition,
can you get away with it?"
</p>

<p>
"Wait and see.  Didn't we get away with Consolidated?"
</p>

<p>
Findlater flung an uneasy glance at his wife.  Harry
Lorenz turned serious.
</p>

<p>
"Don't shout until you're out of the woods; you're not
through with that case yet!  What's become of your old
pal Armstrong?"
</p>

<p>
"He's headed for the high places," said Macgowan
coolly.  "Going to jail, and soon."  He glanced up and
smiled slightly at Mrs. Fowler.  "Academically speaking,
he's headed for prison.  At least, I had a tip that such is
the case.  I'm shedding no tears."
</p>

<p>
There was a general laugh, and then Hemingway intervened.
</p>

<p>
"Ready, Mrs. Fowler?" he piped up hopefully, and a
chord from the piano silenced the talk.
</p>

<p>
Macgowan leaned forward, intent, drinking in the music
with eager senses.  He was supremely content with the
world, supremely confident in himself and his ability.
This was his hour of relaxation, of triumph.  Success had
crowned his talents, and in the past week he had been
drinking deep from the cup of victory.
</p>

<p>
As the final chords of the music died away, Macgowan
was aware of the maid, who leaned over his shoulder with
a quiet word.
</p>

<p>
"There's a gentleman in the hall, sir, who wants to see
you.  He wouldn't give his name or come inside."
</p>

<p>
Macgowan nodded, and under cover of the applause,
rose and left the room.  He passed out into the entrance-hall
and closed the room door behind him.  The closing
of that door was symbolic, had he but known it.
</p>

<p>
He found himself face to face with Robert Dorns, and
behind Dorns was the blue-clad figure of an officer.
</p>

<p>
"Come along, Mac," said Dorns.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER X
</h3>

<p>
The old-fashioned Deming mansion in Evansville,
so often a witness to scenes of gayety or sorrow or
boredom, was to-day shrouded in a singular and
terrible air of hushed expectancy.  Voices were low, every
action was tense.  Old Doctor Irvin, curator of the family's
health these two-score years and more, had come over from
Louisville, and through the high halls flitted two
white-capped nurses.  The servants were tremulous, afraid,
gulping in their throats.
</p>

<p>
Thus Armstrong found the place when he arrived on the
noon train from New York.  Deming took him into the
library, and to his flood of questions lifted a protesting
hand.  Dorothy was ill before her time, and no one knew
what was happening upstairs.
</p>

<p>
"Irvin's got those rooms to himself&mdash;he's turned us all
out and has refused to give out any information," said
Deming brokenly.  "Something's wrong, we know, but
there's nothing to be done.  Irvin has never lost a case in
sixty years of practice&mdash;well, well, hope for the best.  How
did things turn out?  No more trouble?"
</p>

<p>
Armstrong, pacing up and down the room, laughed
harshly.
</p>

<p>
"No more trouble," he repeated, almost bitterly.  He
was fresh from victory, master of those who had sought his
destruction; destiny lay in his hand, yet he turned on
Deming with a swift irony.  "The trouble's over.  We
smashed Macgowan&mdash;but that devil has a most uncanny
brain.  The very last thing, he gave me a word and a look
that I'll never forget.  'How long,' he said to me, with his
damnable sneer, 'how long will these folks let you go on
playing with their money?' That was all.  And it started
me to thinking&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Armstrong resumed his nervous stride up and down.
Deming nodded slowly, wearily.
</p>

<p>
"The easiest thing on earth, Reese, is for a man to fool
himself&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
At this instant the door swung open.  The nurse
appeared, but shook her head at Deming.
</p>

<p>
"The doctor wants Mr. Armstrong upstairs."
</p>

<p>
Armstrong left the library and hastened to the upper
hall.  There he found old Doctor Irvin, outside the closed
door of Dorothy's room.  Irvin swung around to meet
Armstrong, faced him, put hands to shoulders with a
sudden air of challenging defiance.  In the narrowed, keen
old eyes Armstrong read a momentary flare of vivid
enmity which astounded him.  "What is it?" he demanded
swiftly.  "Is she so ill&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You call yourself a husband?" said Irvin, the Donegal
burr coming harshly from his tongue.  "What've ye been
lookin' at all these months, eh?  Why haven't ye been
gripping at the big things instead o' the dollars?  No, not
you.  Grip, grip, grip!  That's all ye can see or do.
Well, there's one thing you can't grip, my man."
</p>

<p>
"What d'you mean?" Armstrong exclaimed, wondering.
"Is Dorothy&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"There's one thing ye can't grip, as you'll learn.  No;
I'm telling the truth when I tell ye that I don't know
about Dorothy.  This thing is mental and spiritual with
her.  She's been so bent on having it out with ye that it'll
either kill or cure&mdash;oh, ye poor blind fool!  There's no
fool like a sincere fool&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Armstrong smiled suddenly.  "I know it, Irvin," he
said quietly.  "I should have written Dorothy&mdash;but it's
one of those things that's mighty hard to write.  I think I
know what you mean, and if I'd only known earlier that
Dorothy realized it also&mdash;well, no matter now.  Is she
very ill?"
</p>

<p>
"She is," said Irvin, staring at him with penetrating
gaze.  "D'you mean to say that you've seen this thing for
yourself?  Well, go your way to her and talk it out, and
heaven send ye may cool down the fever that's in her
heart!  It's her only chance."
</p>

<p>
He swung Armstrong to the door.
</p>

<p>
The room was empty save for the figure on the bed.
Armstrong crossed the floor, knelt beside Dorothy, felt her
fingers creep into his.  Her blue eyes fluttered open, her
look fell upon him like a caress.
</p>

<p>
"Dear!" she said, faintly.  "What kept you away?
You wrote that you'd won&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, we won," said Armstrong, yet cold sweat sprang
on his face.  Dorothy's voice, her mortal pallor, above all
the look in her eyes&mdash;these things pierced him.  He knew
that he must talk swiftly to keep her from talking, as
Irvin had ordered him.
</p>

<p>
"There was more trouble that kept me," he went on.
"Macgowan made a remark that opened my eyes&mdash;dear
girl, I've had a tough time trying to realize the truth of it
all, now I've seen it at last."
</p>

<p>
He paused, trying to find words, and a sudden wondering
smile came to her lips.
</p>

<p>
"Reese!  Nothing has been visible to you except the
things you have seen&mdash;do you understand?  The things
which are seen are temporal&mdash;but those which are not seen
are eternal; and you never saw them.  Is that it?  Have
you&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Hush, my dear," he commanded, and smiled down into
her eyes.  "Yes, that's one way of putting it.  And the
queer thing is that it should have come to me from
Macgowan&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"It didn't&mdash;it came to you from me, from my heart and
mind!"'
</p>

<p>
"Well, it came," he went on hastily.  "It's like Irvin
said&mdash;I've done nothing but grip.  I've denied it, I've
never believed it, but it's been true.  Oh, it's hard to see
myself as I really have been, stripped bare of my fine
theories and plausible words!  Yes, I've reached out only
for the things actual and temporal.  All my fine reasonings
were false at bottom&mdash;I was blinded by everything."
</p>

<p>
Even now, clearly as he saw the fact, he shrank from
the admission; he moved dry lips, trying to deny it, yet
forced himself on to lay bare his inmost self before those
blue eyes that stared up at him, to expose to this wife of
his all the struggle through which he had so lately passed.
</p>

<p>
It was the veriest truth that behind all his actions for
others had been his action for himself.  Had it been to
save Deming that he had gripped so hard, on his wedding-day?
So he had thought, yet now he found the thought
crumbling before the deeper truth.  Had it been for the
sixteen thousand that he had fought Macgowan&mdash;or to
keep himself from going under?  He understood now the
flaming will to victory which even in his own sight had
been masked.  He could no longer delude himself, hypnotize
himself.  The truth faced him in naked guise, and it
was ugly.
</p>

<p>
All this poured from his lips, and Dorothy's fingers
gripped ever more tightly on his, and tears came into her
eyes until she closed them to ease the smart.  Here, where
least expected, she found a new Reese Armstrong&mdash;a man
never glimpsed ere this, glowing with discovery and eager
with action, yet humble and bitterly penitent withal.
</p>

<p>
"I fought it out with myself, Dorothy, and then I took
action," concluded Armstrong.  "I realized that when
it came down to rock bottom, that last bitter jibe of
Macgowan's had a ring of truth.  After all, I've been
playing with other people's money&mdash;just that.  Nothing
criminal in it, nothing wrong in it; yet there's dynamite
underneath.  I've managed to readjust my whole viewpoint on
things, Dorothy&mdash;or I hope that I have."
</p>

<p>
"To find the things which are not seen, dear?" came the
faint voice.
</p>

<p>
"I hope so."  Armstrong nodded and drew a long
breath.  "Well, here's what happened!  I had the whip-hand,
so I came down to the office four days ago and began
to clean house.  First, I got clear out of Consolidated,&mdash;lock,
stock and barrel.  I turned over every scrap of stock
and practically all the ready money I had and could raise&mdash;in
return for which I procured a controlling interest in
the Deming Food concern here.  Then I went to work and
smashed Consolidated&mdash;put it into liquidation.  I don't
dare leave that structure to be grabbed by other men like
Macgowan once I'm out of it.  I've personally guaranteed
that every investor gets his money back in full anytime, if
he doesn't care to wait for the profits of the liquidation&mdash;but
they'll all wait, never fear!  Consolidated can get rid
of all the other companies and then liquidate itself; and
the result will be a good profit for every investor who
hangs on.  And as for me&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Reese?" asked Dorothy quickly, as he paused.  A
smile touched his lips.
</p>

<p>
"Well, as for me, Dorothy&mdash;that's up to you.  I've sort
of figured on selling our little estate, coming back here,
settling down and running the Deming concern, if your
father wants to go into partnership with me.  What do
you say?  I'm through with the big town and the whole
game&mdash;through for good.  I don't want to play with other
people's money any more, Dorothy&mdash;just with my own,
after this.  And besides&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"The things which are seen are temporal," said Dorothy,
and a low laugh came from her throat.  "Oh, Reese,
you've made me so happy!  And now we'll find the other
things together&mdash;the things that are eternal&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Armstrong felt her fingers reach out to him.  He put
down his face and kissed the soft palms, gently, and then
knelt there silently for a long while.  When at last he
lifted his head and looked at her again, she was asleep,
and a smile was on her lips.  The hall door was opening,
and he looked up to see Irvin coming across the room.
Quietly he disengaged himself and went to the door.
Irvin, after a brief examination, joined him in the hall,
closed the door, then caught Armstrong's shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"Look here&mdash;what have you done to her?" he snapped out.
</p>

<p>
Armstrong smiled wearily and wiped his forehead.  He
was very pale.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know, Irvin.  I think the only thing I did was
to make her happy," he said simply.  "How is she
looking&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You're a better doctor than I am, for she's turned the
corner this blessed minute," said Irvin emphatically&mdash;then
suddenly struck Armstrong on the shoulder and gripped
his hand.  "Oh!  By the piper, I clear forgot to tell you!
I wouldn't let a soul know about it until I was sure which
way Dorothy was goin'&mdash;go on into the next room across
the hall&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What for?" demanded Armstrong, in astonishment at
this outburst.
</p>

<p>
Irvin seized his arm and propelled him across the hall-way,
abruptly giving vent to a low and whimsical cackle of
laughter.  He flung open the door.
</p>

<p>
"Go in, ye big rascal, and see what the stork left for ye!"

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
